""And then you have others that are more focused towards middle to lower income consumers or traditional fast food or Wendy's (WEN) or McDonald's (MCD) that have seen a little bit more pressure."" Salera believes ""Papa John's (PZZA) is particularly attractive"" because of the new CEO Todd Penegor, who came with experience from Wendy's, who has already set new goals for the company, including plans to ""re-invigorate the franchisee base and get that reoriented to accelerating unit growth, and then you're also seeing a lot of new promotional offerings in the channel.

While many of the stocks in this sector have dipped, is it time to buy them back up? Stephens research Analyst Jim Salera joins Market Domination to give insight into the best ways to play the restaurant sector amidst some current dips from companies in the sector. ""I think what you really have to look at when you think about restaurants is what consumer the concept is focused on. And so you have high-end consumer restaurant concepts. If you think about Sweetgreen (SG), Cava (CAVA), that have really performed exceptionally well this year and have been really strong stocks,"" Salera says. ""And then you have others that are more focused towards middle to lower income consumers or traditional fast food or Wendy's (WEN) or McDonald's (MCD) that have seen a little bit more pressure."" Salera believes ""Papa John's (PZZA) is particularly attractive"" because of the new CEO Todd Penegor, who came with experience from Wendy's, who has already set new goals for the company, including plans to ""re-invigorate the franchisee base and get that reoriented to accelerating unit growth, and then you're also seeing a lot of new promotional offerings in the channel.

While implementing AI to improve operations productivity, Schulman underlines the fact that ""technology is to enhance human experience, not replace it."" He describes Cava's ""connected kitchen"" technology, which uses generative AI to detect food depletion on the service line.

While many of the stocks in this sector have dipped, is it time to buy them back up? Stephens research Analyst Jim Salera joins Market Domination to give insight into the best ways to play the restaurant sector amidst some current dips from companies in the sector. ""I think what you really have to look at when you think about restaurants is what consumer the concept is focused on. And so you have high-end consumer restaurant concepts. If you think about Sweetgreen (SG), Cava (CAVA), that have really performed exceptionally well this year and have been really strong stocks,"" Salera says. ""And then you have others that are more focused towards middle to lower income consumers or traditional fast food or Wendy's (WEN) or McDonald's (MCD) that have seen a little bit more pressure."" Salera believes ""Papa John's (PZZA) is particularly attractive"" because of the new CEO Todd Penegor, who came with experience from Wendy's, who has already set new goals for the company, including plans to ""re-invigorate the franchisee base and get that reoriented to accelerating unit growth, and then you're also seeing a lot of new promotional offerings in the channel.

While implementing AI to improve operations productivity, Schulman underlines the fact that ""technology is to enhance human experience, not replace it."" He describes Cava's ""connected kitchen"" technology, which uses generative AI to detect food depletion on the service line.

He ranks integrity as the most crucial factor, followed by a unique business concept, creativity, potential, and a great product or service. ""In life, the people that I want to hire, the people that I want to work with, are people that can grow,"" he told Yahoo Finance. Within his own business of snacking, Lubetzky acknowledges the unhealthy nature of the food industry saying ""it's very real."" With ultra-processed ingredients such as refined sugars, refined carbs, and artificial dyes/sweeteners, he believes that companies don't do ""enough to educate the consumer."" He adds; ""It's not the right way to build our society."" Lubetzky also highlighted his recent investment in Cava (CAVA), the Mediterranean fast-casual chain that has seen its stock soar since going public last year. Despite inflation still impacting businesses across the economy, Lubetzky remains confident in the brand, stating, ""For me, my experience is if you have a great product or service and you're at a growth stage, these things don't phase you.""

Stephens research Analyst Jim Salera joins Market Domination to give insight into the best ways to play the restaurant sector amidst some current dips from companies in the sector. ""I think what you really have to look at when you think about restaurants is what consumer the concept is focused on. And so you have high-end consumer restaurant concepts.

""And then you have others that are more focused towards middle to lower income consumers or traditional fast food or Wendy's (WEN) or McDonald's (MCD) that have seen a little bit more pressure.""

Schulman emphasizes Cava's ""compelling value proposition"" as a healthier Mediterranean chain that meets ""the needs of the modern consumer who wants to eat better but doesn't want to sacrifice flavor or fulfillment."" He distinguishes between price and value: ""price is what you pay for something, but value is the worth of what you get,"" noting that Cava strives to deliver on all fronts including quality, convenience, and experience. Regarding new menu offerings, Schulman highlights the addition of steak and states that a ""deep pipeline of innovation"" is core to the food chain's goals of enhancing the guest experience. While implementing AI to improve operations productivity, Schulman underlines the fact that ""technology is to enhance human experience, not replace it."" He describes Cava's ""connected kitchen"" technology, which uses generative AI to detect food depletion on the service line. This system then projects to prep cooks on what they should be preparing, ""to take all that complexity of the mindshare off our team members so they can be forward-facing, focused on that great Mediterranean hospitality."" ""Our mission is to bring heart, health, and humanity to food, and if we lost that humanity piece, I don't think we'd be living up to our mission,"" Schulman tells Yahoo Finance.

Cava CEO Brett Schulman joins the Morning Brief to discuss Cava's growth and the overall state of the restaurant sector. Schulman explains that Cava's latest earnings revealed ""consistent strength across all income segments,"" which he attributes to the company's value proposition: ""We're able to deliver that unique Mediterranean cuisine where tastes and health unite and do it at a reasonable price."" He explains that Cava brings value to customers not just through price, but through quality as well. Cava is seeking to relaunch its loyalty program by the end of the year as consumers are increasingly seeking deals. Schulman notes that the program will serve as ""a way to really create our first-party audience and to be able to engage in a one-to-one way with our guests, the way they operate through our brand, the way that they behave, and be able to surface relevant content to them."" The program will use a points-based system that consumers can redeem for a variety of rewards. As for the industry as a whole, Schulman explains, ""we sit at an interesting kind of nexus between a traditional fast food below us and legacy full-service chain dining above us."" He notes that full-service dining has increased in price and time commitment, whereas customers could go to Cava for reasonable time commitment and value. Similarly, fast food prices have increased, which has amplified Cava's value proposition. For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Morning Brief.

When evaluating pitches on the show, Lubetzky emphasizes the importance of authenticity, claiming he has ""a sixth sense for it."" He ranks integrity as the most crucial factor, followed by a unique business concept, creativity, potential, and a great product or service. ""In life, the people that I want to hire, the people that I want to work with, are people that can grow,"" he told Yahoo Finance. Within his own business of snacking, Lubetzky acknowledges the unhealthy nature of the food industry saying ""it's very real."" With ultra-processed ingredients such as refined sugars, refined carbs, and artificial dyes/sweeteners, he believes that companies don't do ""enough to educate the consumer."" He adds; ""It's not the right way to build our society."" Lubetzky also highlighted his recent investment in Cava (CAVA), the Mediterranean fast-casual chain that has seen its stock soar since going public last year. Despite inflation still impacting businesses across the economy, Lubetzky remains confident in the brand, stating, ""For me, my experience is if you have a great product or service and you're at a growth stage, these things don't phase you.""

Schulman emphasizes Cava's ""compelling value proposition"" as a healthier Mediterranean chain that meets ""the needs of the modern consumer who wants to eat better but doesn't want to sacrifice flavor or fulfillment."" He distinguishes between price and value: ""price is what you pay for something, but value is the worth of what you get,"" noting that Cava strives to deliver on all fronts including quality, convenience, and experience. Regarding new menu offerings, Schulman highlights the addition of steak and states that a ""deep pipeline of innovation"" is core to the food chain's goals of enhancing the guest experience. While implementing AI to improve operations productivity, Schulman underlines the fact that ""technology is to enhance human experience, not replace it."" He describes Cava's ""connected kitchen"" technology, which uses generative AI to detect food depletion on the service line. This system then projects to prep cooks on what they should be preparing, ""to take all that complexity of the mindshare off our team members so they can be forward-facing, focused on that great Mediterranean hospitality."" ""Our mission is to bring heart, health, and humanity to food, and if we lost that humanity piece, I don't think we'd be living up to our mission,"" Schulman tells Yahoo Finance.

Cava CEO Brett Schulman joins the Morning Brief to discuss Cava's growth and the overall state of the restaurant sector. Schulman explains that Cava's latest earnings revealed ""consistent strength across all income segments,"" which he attributes to the company's value proposition: ""We're able to deliver that unique Mediterranean cuisine where tastes and health unite and do it at a reasonable price."" He explains that Cava brings value to customers not just through price, but through quality as well. Cava is seeking to relaunch its loyalty program by the end of the year as consumers are increasingly seeking deals. Schulman notes that the program will serve as ""a way to really create our first-party audience and to be able to engage in a one-to-one way with our guests, the way they operate through our brand, the way that they behave, and be able to surface relevant content to them."" The program will use a points-based system that consumers can redeem for a variety of rewards. As for the industry as a whole, Schulman explains, ""we sit at an interesting kind of nexus between a traditional fast food below us and legacy full-service chain dining above us."" He notes that full-service dining has increased in price and time commitment, whereas customers could go to Cava for reasonable time commitment and value. Similarly, fast food prices have increased, which has amplified Cava's value proposition. For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Morning Brief.

While many of the stocks in this sector have dipped, is it time to buy them back up? Stephens research Analyst Jim Salera joins Market Domination to give insight into the best ways to play the restaurant sector amidst some current dips from companies in the sector. ""I think what you really have to look at when you think about restaurants is what consumer the concept is focused on. And so you have high-end consumer restaurant concepts. If you think about Sweetgreen (SG), Cava (CAVA), that have really performed exceptionally well this year and have been really strong stocks,"" Salera says. ""And then you have others that are more focused towards middle to lower income consumers or traditional fast food or Wendy's (WEN) or McDonald's (MCD) that have seen a little bit more pressure."" Salera believes ""Papa John's (PZZA) is particularly attractive"" because of the new CEO Todd Penegor, who came with experience from Wendy's, who has already set new goals for the company, including plans to ""re-invigorate the franchisee base and get that reoriented to accelerating unit growth, and then you're also seeing a lot of new promotional offerings in the channel.

Schulman emphasizes Cava's ""compelling value proposition"" as a healthier Mediterranean chain that meets ""the needs of the modern consumer who wants to eat better but doesn't want to sacrifice flavor or fulfillment."" He distinguishes between price and value: ""price is what you pay for something, but value is the worth of what you get,"" noting that Cava strives to deliver on all fronts including quality, convenience, and experience. Regarding new menu offerings, Schulman highlights the addition of steak and states that a ""deep pipeline of innovation"" is core to the food chain's goals of enhancing the guest experience. While implementing AI to improve operations productivity, Schulman underlines the fact that ""technology is to enhance human experience, not replace it."" He describes Cava's ""connected kitchen"" technology, which uses generative AI to detect food depletion on the service line. This system then projects to prep cooks on what they should be preparing, ""to take all that complexity of the mindshare off our team members so they can be forward-facing, focused on that great Mediterranean hospitality."" ""Our mission is to bring heart, health, and humanity to food, and if we lost that humanity piece, I don't think we'd be living up to our mission,"" Schulman tells Yahoo Finance.

Cava CEO Brett Schulman joins the Morning Brief to discuss Cava's growth and the overall state of the restaurant sector. Schulman explains that Cava's latest earnings revealed ""consistent strength across all income segments,"" which he attributes to the company's value proposition: ""We're able to deliver that unique Mediterranean cuisine where tastes and health unite and do it at a reasonable price."" He explains that Cava brings value to customers not just through price, but through quality as well. Cava is seeking to relaunch its loyalty program by the end of the year as consumers are increasingly seeking deals. Schulman notes that the program will serve as ""a way to really create our first-party audience and to be able to engage in a one-to-one way with our guests, the way they operate through our brand, the way that they behave, and be able to surface relevant content to them."" The program will use a points-based system that consumers can redeem for a variety of rewards. As for the industry as a whole, Schulman explains, ""we sit at an interesting kind of nexus between a traditional fast food below us and legacy full-service chain dining above us."" He notes that full-service dining has increased in price and time commitment, whereas customers could go to Cava for reasonable time commitment and value. Similarly, fast food prices have increased, which has amplified Cava's value proposition. For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Morning Brief.

While many of the stocks in this sector have dipped, is it time to buy them back up?

""And then you have others that are more focused towards middle to lower income consumers or traditional fast food or Wendy's (WEN) or McDonald's (MCD) that have seen a little bit more pressure."" Salera believes ""Papa John's (PZZA) is particularly attractive"" because of the new CEO Todd Penegor, who came with experience from Wendy's, who has already set new goals for the company, including plans to ""re-invigorate the franchisee base and get that reoriented to accelerating unit growth, and then you're also seeing a lot of new promotional offerings in the channel.

The Mediterranean fast-casual chain saw robust sales growth of 9.5% year-over-year and raised its full-year guidance. Cava Co-Founder and CEO Brett Schulman joins Morning Brief alongside senior reporter Brooke DiPalma to discuss the company's success and future plans. Schulman emphasizes Cava's ""compelling value proposition"" as a healthier Mediterranean chain that meets ""the needs of the modern consumer who wants to eat better but doesn't want to sacrifice flavor or fulfillment."" He distinguishes between price and value: ""price is what you pay for something, but value is the worth of what you get,"" noting that Cava strives to deliver on all fronts including quality, convenience, and experience. Regarding new menu offerings, Schulman highlights the addition of steak and states that a ""deep pipeline of innovation"" is core to the food chain's goals of enhancing the guest experience. While implementing AI to improve operations productivity, Schulman underlines the fact that ""technology is to enhance human experience, not replace it."" He describes Cava's ""connected kitchen"" technology, which uses generative AI to detect food depletion on the service line. This system then projects to prep cooks on what they should be preparing, ""to take all that complexity of the mindshare off our team members so they can be forward-facing, focused on that great Mediterranean hospitality."" ""Our mission is to bring heart, health, and humanity to food, and if we lost that humanity piece, I don't think we'd be living up to our mission,"" Schulman tells Yahoo Finance.

Cava CEO Brett Schulman joins the Morning Brief to discuss Cava's growth and the overall state of the restaurant sector. Schulman explains that Cava's latest earnings revealed ""consistent strength across all income segments,"" which he attributes to the company's value proposition: ""We're able to deliver that unique Mediterranean cuisine where tastes and health unite and do it at a reasonable price."" He explains that Cava brings value to customers not just through price, but through quality as well. Cava is seeking to relaunch its loyalty program by the end of the year as consumers are increasingly seeking deals. Schulman notes that the program will serve as ""a way to really create our first-party audience and to be able to engage in a one-to-one way with our guests, the way they operate through our brand, the way that they behave, and be able to surface relevant content to them."" The program will use a points-based system that consumers can redeem for a variety of rewards. As for the industry as a whole, Schulman explains, ""we sit at an interesting kind of nexus between a traditional fast food below us and legacy full-service chain dining above us."" He notes that full-service dining has increased in price and time commitment, whereas customers could go to Cava for reasonable time commitment and value. Similarly, fast food prices have increased, which has amplified Cava's value proposition. For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Morning Brief.

He distinguishes between price and value: ""price is what you pay for something, but value is the worth of what you get,"" noting that Cava strives to deliver on all fronts including quality, convenience, and experience. Regarding new menu offerings, Schulman highlights the addition of steak and states that a ""deep pipeline of innovation"" is core to the food chain's goals of enhancing the guest experience. While implementing AI to improve operations productivity, Schulman underlines the fact that ""technology is to enhance human experience, not replace it."" He describes Cava's ""connected kitchen"" technology, which uses generative AI to detect food depletion on the service line. This system then projects to prep cooks on what they should be preparing, ""to take all that complexity of the mindshare off our team members so they can be forward-facing, focused on that great Mediterranean hospitality."" ""Our mission is to bring heart, health, and humanity to food, and if we lost that humanity piece, I don't think we'd be living up to our mission,"" Schulman tells Yahoo Finance.

Cava CEO Brett Schulman joins the Morning Brief to discuss Cava's growth and the overall state of the restaurant sector. Schulman explains that Cava's latest earnings revealed ""consistent strength across all income segments,"" which he attributes to the company's value proposition: ""We're able to deliver that unique Mediterranean cuisine where tastes and health unite and do it at a reasonable price."" He explains that Cava brings value to customers not just through price, but through quality as well. Cava is seeking to relaunch its loyalty program by the end of the year as consumers are increasingly seeking deals. Schulman notes that the program will serve as ""a way to really create our first-party audience and to be able to engage in a one-to-one way with our guests, the way they operate through our brand, the way that they behave, and be able to surface relevant content to them."" The program will use a points-based system that consumers can redeem for a variety of rewards. As for the industry as a whole, Schulman explains, ""we sit at an interesting kind of nexus between a traditional fast food below us and legacy full-service chain dining above us."" He notes that full-service dining has increased in price and time commitment, whereas customers could go to Cava for reasonable time commitment and value. Similarly, fast food prices have increased, which has amplified Cava's value proposition. For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Morning Brief.

He distinguishes between price and value: ""price is what you pay for something, but value is the worth of what you get,"" noting that Cava strives to deliver on all fronts including quality, convenience, and experience. Regarding new menu offerings, Schulman highlights the addition of steak and states that a ""deep pipeline of innovation"" is core to the food chain's goals of enhancing the guest experience. While implementing AI to improve operations productivity, Schulman underlines the fact that ""technology is to enhance human experience, not replace it."" He describes Cava's ""connected kitchen"" technology, which uses generative AI to detect food depletion on the service line. This system then projects to prep cooks on what they should be preparing, ""to take all that complexity of the mindshare off our team members so they can be forward-facing, focused on that great Mediterranean hospitality.""

Cava CEO Brett Schulman joins the Morning Brief to discuss Cava's growth and the overall state of the restaurant sector. Schulman explains that Cava's latest earnings revealed ""consistent strength across all income segments,"" which he attributes to the company's value proposition: ""We're able to deliver that unique Mediterranean cuisine where tastes and health unite and do it at a reasonable price."" He explains that Cava brings value to customers not just through price, but through quality as well. Cava is seeking to relaunch its loyalty program by the end of the year as consumers are increasingly seeking deals. Schulman notes that the program will serve as ""a way to really create our first-party audience and to be able to engage in a one-to-one way with our guests, the way they operate through our brand, the way that they behave, and be able to surface relevant content to them."" The program will use a points-based system that consumers can redeem for a variety of rewards. As for the industry as a whole, Schulman explains, ""we sit at an interesting kind of nexus between a traditional fast food below us and legacy full-service chain dining above us."" He notes that full-service dining has increased in price and time commitment, whereas customers could go to Cava for reasonable time commitment and value. Similarly, fast food prices have increased, which has amplified Cava's value proposition. For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Morning Brief.

While many of the stocks in this sector have dipped, is it time to buy them back up? Stephens research Analyst Jim Salera joins Market Domination to give insight into the best ways to play the restaurant sector amidst some current dips from companies in the sector. ""I think what you really have to look at when you think about restaurants is what consumer the concept is focused on. And so you have high-end consumer restaurant concepts. If you think about Sweetgreen (SG), Cava (CAVA), that have really performed exceptionally well this year and have been really strong stocks,"" Salera says. ""And then you have others that are more focused towards middle to lower income consumers or traditional fast food or Wendy's (WEN) or McDonald's (MCD) that have seen a little bit more pressure."" Salera believes ""Papa John's (PZZA) is particularly attractive"" because of the new CEO Todd Penegor, who came with experience from Wendy's, who has already set new goals for the company, including plans to ""re-invigorate the franchisee base and get that reoriented to accelerating unit growth, and then you're also seeing a lot of new promotional offerings in the channel.

Regarding new menu offerings, Schulman highlights the addition of steak and states that a ""deep pipeline of innovation"" is core to the food chain's goals of enhancing the guest experience. While implementing AI to improve operations productivity, Schulman underlines the fact that ""technology is to enhance human experience, not replace it."" He describes Cava's ""connected kitchen"" technology, which uses generative AI to detect food depletion on the service line. This system then projects to prep cooks on what they should be preparing, ""to take all that complexity of the mindshare off our team members so they can be forward-facing, focused on that great Mediterranean hospitality.""

Cava CEO Brett Schulman joins the Morning Brief to discuss Cava's growth and the overall state of the restaurant sector. Schulman explains that Cava's latest earnings revealed ""consistent strength across all income segments,"" which he attributes to the company's value proposition: ""We're able to deliver that unique Mediterranean cuisine where tastes and health unite and do it at a reasonable price."" He explains that Cava brings value to customers not just through price, but through quality as well. Cava is seeking to relaunch its loyalty program by the end of the year as consumers are increasingly seeking deals. Schulman notes that the program will serve as ""a way to really create our first-party audience and to be able to engage in a one-to-one way with our guests, the way they operate through our brand, the way that they behave, and be able to surface relevant content to them."" The program will use a points-based system that consumers can redeem for a variety of rewards. As for the industry as a whole, Schulman explains, ""we sit at an interesting kind of nexus between a traditional fast food below us and legacy full-service chain dining above us."" He notes that full-service dining has increased in price and time commitment, whereas customers could go to Cava for reasonable time commitment and value. Similarly, fast food prices have increased, which has amplified Cava's value proposition. For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Morning Brief.

While many of the stocks in this sector have dipped, is it time to buy them back up? Stephens research Analyst Jim Salera joins Market Domination to give insight into the best ways to play the restaurant sector amidst some current dips from companies in the sector. ""I think what you really have to look at when you think about restaurants is what consumer the concept is focused on. And so you have high-end consumer restaurant concepts. If you think about Sweetgreen (SG), Cava (CAVA), that have really performed exceptionally well this year and have been really strong stocks,"" Salera says. ""And then you have others that are more focused towards middle to lower income consumers or traditional fast food or Wendy's (WEN) or McDonald's (MCD) that have seen a little bit more pressure."" Salera believes ""Papa John's (PZZA) is particularly attractive"" because of the new CEO Todd Penegor, who came with experience from Wendy's, who has already set new goals for the company, including plans to ""re-invigorate the franchisee base and get that reoriented to accelerating unit growth, and then you're also seeing a lot of new promotional offerings in the channel.

While implementing AI to improve operations productivity, Schulman underlines the fact that ""technology is to enhance human experience, not replace it."" He describes Cava's ""connected kitchen"" technology, which uses generative AI to detect food depletion on the service line.

Cava CEO Brett Schulman joins the Morning Brief to discuss Cava's growth and the overall state of the restaurant sector. Schulman explains that Cava's latest earnings revealed ""consistent strength across all income segments,"" which he attributes to the company's value proposition: ""We're able to deliver that unique Mediterranean cuisine where tastes and health unite and do it at a reasonable price."" He explains that Cava brings value to customers not just through price, but through quality as well. Cava is seeking to relaunch its loyalty program by the end of the year as consumers are increasingly seeking deals. Schulman notes that the program will serve as ""a way to really create our first-party audience and to be able to engage in a one-to-one way with our guests, the way they operate through our brand, the way that they behave, and be able to surface relevant content to them."" The program will use a points-based system that consumers can redeem for a variety of rewards. As for the industry as a whole, Schulman explains, ""we sit at an interesting kind of nexus between a traditional fast food below us and legacy full-service chain dining above us."" He notes that full-service dining has increased in price and time commitment, whereas customers could go to Cava for reasonable time commitment and value. Similarly, fast food prices have increased, which has amplified Cava's value proposition. For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Morning Brief.
