Why You Might Want to Buy This Unstoppable Growth Stock Instead.,"Shares of Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG) are down around 15% from their peak earlier in the year. That's not unusual; the stock has gone through much larger drawdowns before. But this is not the same company it was a decade ago, it is now an industry giant with more than 3,500 locations globally. If you are wondering whether or not Chipotle's best growth is behind it, then you might want to trade down to a smaller company like Cava Group (NYSE: CAVA). In the second quarter (ended June 30), Chipotle's same-store sales rose a huge 11.1%. Add in new store openings and the top line expanded by 18.2%. These are both incredibly strong numbers for a large restaurant brand. The truth is that most sizable restaurants would be ecstatic if they could expand same-store sales in the low single digits. There's a reason why Chipotle is afforded a premium valuation, noting that its price-to-earnings ratio is 55 times or so. By comparison, fast-food giant McDonald's has a P/E ratio of around 26 times, less than half the level of Chipotle. Investors are clearly paying up for Chipotle stock, which helps explain the steep sell-off. When things go wrong at companies with pricey stocks, investors often sell first and ask questions later. The ""wrong"" at Chipotle right now is a big management transition. It lost its CEO to coffee giant Starbucks. That CEO was well respected and investors are likely worried that it will be hard to fill his shoes. It doesn't help that recent sales results have been strong, either, because any pullback will probably be viewed as a sign of weakness rather than just a natural reversion to the mean. But there's a bigger issue here: Chipotle is no longer a tiny start-up with huge expansion opportunities ahead of it. If that's what you are looking for, now might be a good time for you to consider switching to Cava Group. Cava's food concept isn't exactly new. It is basically taking the assembly-line formula that Chipotle made popular and applying it to Mediterranean food. But that's the allure here, since Cava could potentially turn into the next Chipotle. Right now Cava only operates around 341 locations, a tiny fraction of Chipotle's total store count. But that means Cava could have years of growth ahead of it. Since Cava is so small, meanwhile, it can't rush out and open up hundreds of locations. It just doesn't have that operational capacity. It only managed to open 18 new locations in the second quarter of 2024, bringing its year-over-year store count growth to a huge 22%! Small but steady success here can lead to massive change. To put a number on that, Cava's top line grew 35% year over year in the second quarter (ended July 14). That included same-store sales growth of 14%. To be fair, neither of those numbers is likely to be sustainable over the very long term. But there was a nearly 10% increase in store traffic, which hints that the Cava concept continues to gain favor with new consumers. So there's good reason to think that Cava has a solid opportunity to keep expanding. Cava is clearly a much smaller company than Chipotle and the risks are probably higher for investors if it stumbles. But if you think Chipotle's best growth days are behind it, you might want to consider putting some money into a similar concept that's only just starting to expand. A comparison to Chipotle suggests that there are years, if not decades, of growth ahead for Cava.

(CAVA) Very Much’","We recently published an article titled Jim Cramer on Super Micro Computer and Other Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where CAVA Group, Inc. (NYSE:CAVA) stands against the other super micro computer stocks. As earnings season kicks off, Mad Money's host, Jim Cramer reminds investors that bad news can often be factored into a stock's price ahead of an earnings report. He cited the recent example of PepsiCo, which saw its shares decline before rebounding despite reporting a revenue miss. Cramer highlighted that when a stock has already faced significant sell-offs leading into a quarter, it is challenging for it to drop further unless the results are exceptionally poor. “This is something you need to keep in mind as we head into earnings season,” he advised, emphasizing the market dynamics at play. Cramer also expressed his disagreement with the Department of Justice's exploration of a potential breakup of Google. He argued that such companies play a vital role for consumers, businesses, and the U.S. economy. Acknowledging the power of major tech firms, Cramer pointed out that their substantial customer bases and immense financial resources provide them with advantages that are essential for success. He went on to say that these companies have become the envy of nations, especially considering that many countries invest heavily in nurturing their own national champions. In contrast, Cramer questioned the approach taken in the U.S., emphasizing the need for capital to foster growth. “The best companies we have, the best companies in the world, we're dealing with companies that have done amazing things for the American people, and yet they're vilified by the Justice Department's antitrust division, [and] of course, the Federal Trade Commission. Think about it.” He warned that if the courts side with the DOJ and the FTC, consumers might not benefit as expected. Cramer explained that undermining these companies could open the door for foreign entities, particularly those backed by government subsidies, to fill any gaps left in the market. “Believe me, if the courts agree with the Justice [Department] and the FTC, let me tell you something. Here's what's going to happen. Your prices ain't coming down, they're going up. We hurt these companies too much and we don't have to worry, the PRC will come in with something subsidized by their government that will happily step in the void.” He challenged the perception that wealth generated by these tech giants is solely hoarded by executives, asserting that investors also stand to gain. He stated:                  ",

Since CAVA Group Inc (NYSE:CAVA) ranks 8th on the list, it deserves a deeper look. Jim Cramer in a latest program on CNBC talked about the ills of “complacency” in investing and how sticking to a specific narrative costs investors money. He was criticizing negative analyst reports that keep downgrading stocks. “We always hear how the bulls are being complacent and ignore downside risk. We almost never hear that the bears are being complacent and missing out on terrific opportunities, which I find to be absurd. Nobody does complacency like the bears. Remember, last night I spent a lot of time talking about how we had a slew of downgrades yesterday that I did not like, and stocks reacting to negative news already. Today, they seem like fortuitous notes that would end up costing you money if you listen to them.” Cramer said that some analysts like to “take aim” at long-term winners and scare people out of some “amazing gains.” This, Cramer believes, is “downright wrong.” He said that even if investors want to sell a stock based on a downgrade, they should wait for it to “bounce” before pulling the trigger. For this article we talked about 10 stocks Jim Cramer is talking about during his programs on CNBC. With each company we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors.

And if it comes down, I want you to be able to buy more. It’s one of the great new concepts that we’ve seen in this market.” Over the past year CAVA Group Inc (NYSE:CAVA) is up about 300% and the stock is trading at a forward P/E of over 200. What makes this restaurant stock so special? It’s a fast-casual chain offering Mediterranean-inspired meals and has built its reputation on fresh, healthy ingredients and a mix of dine-in and takeaway options. In the second quarter, the chain reported a 35% rise in revenue year over year, with same-store sales up 14.4%, helped by a 9.5% increase in guest traffic.

As of this writing the stock in the Mediterranean restaurant chain is up a whopping 300% in the last 12 months, making it one of the best-performing stocks in the world over the last year. The recent IPO has become an investor favorite with its strong traffic growth and room to expand its restaurant locations around the nation. However, the stock now has a demanding valuation with a market cap of $14 billion and less than $1 billion in sales. Where will Cava Group stock be in five years, and should you buy or sell shares today? Time to take a closer look and analyze this 2024 investor favorite. The founders of Cava had a fantastic idea: take the success of Chipotle and apply it to another international cuisine. They chose Mediterranean-style food, and it has become a hit. Cava now has 341 locations spread around the United States, with unit count growing by over 20% year over year last quarter. In 2024, it expects to open around 55 new locations. Even better is Cava's traffic and same-store sales growth. When a Cava opens in a new location, it consistently sees upticks in traffic when people try out the concept and become fans of the food. I mean, who isn't a fan of a steak and feta pita wrap? Last quarter, traffic to Cava restaurants -- on a per-restaurant basis -- grew 9.5% year over year. Same-store sales growth was 14.4%. Same-store sales measure the sales from existing restaurant locations. Typically, a restaurant will generate low single-digit percentage growth for same-store sales. Cava's near 15% growth blows most restaurants out of the water. Profitability is strong. Cava's restaurant-level profit margins are 26.5%, which should translate to at least 10% to 15% consolidated profit margins when including overhead costs once the company stops pushing for growth so aggressively. Today, it has an operating margin of slightly above 5%. Restaurant brands can be great growth investments because of the easy path to expanding unit count across the United States (and eventually internationally). Cava looks to be on a similar path as Chipotle and believes it can reach at least 1,000 locations in the United States, if not more. Today, the company has 341 locations and plans to add 55 locations to its arsenal this year. If the company can add an average of 75 units per year for the next five years, it will have 716 locations in five years, or more than double what it has today. That is a clear growth prospect that has the investment community excited.            ",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where CAVA Group Inc. (NYSE:CAVA) stands against the other high short interest stocks. China's housing market, once a booming sector, has experienced a significant downturn in recent years. To revitalize the market, the government recently implemented a series of policy changes aimed at stimulating demand. These changes include easing home-buying restrictions in major cities like Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Shanghai. The relaxation of these restrictions has had a positive impact on the stock market. Investors, encouraged by the government's efforts, have been pouring money into Chinese stocks, particularly those related to the real estate sector. This surge in investment has led to a significant increase in stock prices. The CSI 300 index saw its most significant weekly gain since 2008, rising over 15% in late September 2024 While all of this activity has had a positive short-term impact, economists believe that more measures are needed to address China's weak domestic demand. The housing market is still grappling with concerns about developer solvency and the overall economic outlook. The government's efforts to address these issues will be crucial for the long-term recovery of the housing market and the broader economy. On September 27, Jeremy Siegel, Wharton School professor of finance, joined CNBC's 'Squawk on the Street' to discuss how much of a game changer recent news from China is. He shared his insights on the potential implications of global market changes, particularly in light of discussions surrounding Japan and China. Siegel agreed with hedge fund manager David Tepper's views but noted a divergence regarding Japan's long-term appreciation and its effects on exports and interest rates. He highlighted that, despite concerns, the recent performance of the Japanese yen and Nikkei, showing gains of 2% each, indicates that there may still be opportunities to capitalize on these markets. He emphasized the positive developments in China, suggesting that buying into a market with a price-to-earnings ratio of around 10 can be advantageous, especially considering the current P/E ratio for China is approximately 12 to 13. He pointed out that this valuation is relatively low compared to other markets, with Brazil being one of the few markets with an even lower ratio. Siegel referenced Warren Buffett's concept of ""margin of safety"" when investing in low P/E markets, reinforcing his belief in the potential for gains in China despite some bearish sentiments.

(CAVA) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It","Cava Group (CAVA) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock. Over the past month, shares of this Mediterranean restaurant chain have returned +7.9%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.3% change. During this period, the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry, which Cava falls in, has gained 5.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction? Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision. Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings. We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements. For the current quarter, Cava is expected to post earnings of $0.11 per share, indicating a change of +83.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days. The consensus earnings estimate of $0.43 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +104.8%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $0.51 indicates a change of +18.9% from what Cava is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged. Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Cava is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).               ",

Why They May Be Right.,"Investors have long been searching for a fast-casual chain that could become the next Chipotle (NYSE: CMG). That's for good reason, Chipotle stock generated a 6,500%-plus return since its IPO in January 2006. While investors are still searching, it appears Wall Street has found its next contender. Market analysts are starting to compare Cava Group (NYSE: CAVA) to the revered Tex-Mex restaurant chain. Wedbush Securities analyst Nick Setyan recently said: ""No one had been able to kind of transform the Mexican category into a national chain, and Chipotle did that. Cava is doing the same thing with the Mediterranean cuisine and concept."" Let's look at how Cava is similar to Chipotle in its early days as a public company and why retail investors might want to listen to the Wall Street analysts touting this stock as the next big restaurant stock winner. The first way that Cava is similar to Chipotle is that both chains operate based on similar concepts that are loved by customers. Namely, combining fresh, popular ingredients into a meal quickly and relatively inexpensively. The customer enthusiasm can be seen in Cava's recent same-restaurant sales results. For fiscal year 2023, the company's comparable-restaurant sales were up a robust 17.9%. Cava kept that momentum going this year, with the company reporting a 14.4% surge in same-store sales for Q2. While many restaurant chains report some consumer fatigue from higher prices, Cava saw its Q2 same-store traffic surge by 9.5% despite menu prices being 4.9% higher. That shows that the company has pricing power and that it is drawing in more new customers. Chipotle saw similar robust comparable-restaurant sales in its early days. For example, its same-store sales were 13.7% in fiscal year 2006 and 10.8% in fiscal 2007. Chipotle managed to put up solid same-store sales for much of its public existence, including 11.1% growth in its most recent quarter. Cava's business model is similar to Chipotle's. Both concepts have a limited number of ingredients for customers to customize their meals in an assembly line process. At the time of its IPO last year, Cava said it had 38 ingredients that could make 17.4 billion food combinations. This is a very efficient model; with fewer ingredients, it reduces food waste while the assembly line process speeds up customer wait times while also giving them a customized experience.

Shares surged more than 300% over the past 12 months. Given the current lofty price of Cava stock, it's almost hard to believe it was at a 52-week low of $29.05 last October. And Cava's debut as a public company, in June 2023, was at $22 per share. Can the stock's massive run up continue, or is it too late to buy shares? The stock has pulled back from its 52-week high of $131.82 reached in September, so this could indicate a potential buy opportunity. To know if now is a good time to pick up Cava shares, let's dig into this hot company. Cava's spectacular stock performance is understandable when you look at its sales. In its fiscal second quarter, ended July 14, revenue rose an impressive 35% year over year to $231.4 million. Q2 was the latest in Cava's streak of rapidly rising revenue during its short life as a public company. Its performance in the first half of fiscal 2024 suggests the company could possibly reach $1 billion in full-year sales. Fiscal Time Period Revenue YOY Change First half of 2024 $492.5 million 31% 2023 $717.1 million 60% 2022 $448.6 million 61% Data source: Cava Group. YOY = year-over-year. Cava's trend of expanding revenue is due to a combination of opening new restaurants, and surging sales at existing locations. In Q2, Cava opened 18 restaurants, bringing its total to 341, while sales in existing locations grew 14% year over year. Sales growth was only the beginning of excellent Q2 financials. Cava's net income in the quarter shot up to $19.7 million from $6.5 million in the prior year. The company also generated Q2 free cash flow (FCF) of $22.7 million, a dramatic turnaround from its negative FCF of $12 million in 2023. The restaurant chain exited Q2 with an excellent balance sheet as well. Total assets stood at $1 billion, while total liabilities were $443 million. Cava CEO Brett Schulman plans to foster Cava's sales growth by focusing on a few strategic priorities. One of these is to continue opening new restaurants. When Cava exited its 2023 fiscal year, ended Dec. 31, it forecast opening between 48 to 52 new locations in 2024. Thanks to its strong sales, in Q2, the company raised this guidance to between 54 to 57 new restaurants. Cava is funding new restaurant openings through its cash from operations. This is a positive sign, since the approach avoids accumulating debt to pay for expansion. Another of its strategies is the rollout of a new nationwide loyalty program, facilitated through its mobile app. The company generates a substantial 36% of its income from digital sales, so a new rewards program could be a key factor in boosting revenue.

If you do find the next breakout chain, though, it could turn your investment parabolic. There are a few fairly new initial public offering (IPO) stocks that have strong momentum and potential. Cava Group (NYSE: CAVA) and Dutch Bros (NYSE: BROS) are two that deserve a look from growth investors. Cava made a big splash when it went public last summer. I wonder if it would have caught as much attention if it had gone public during a time with more IPO activity. Right before the last bear market hit in 2022, there were two back-to-back years of record IPOs. That came to an abrupt halt, and Cava was an exciting option when there was a dearth of IPOs. Investors loved Cava right from the start, and it's going splendidly. Cava is reporting strong growth and even profits, not a sure thing from young growth stocks. Sales were up 35% year over year in the second quarter with a strong contribution from same-stores sales, which were up 14%. The company has 341 total stores as of the end of the quarter, quite a small number, and it anticipates opening up to 1,000 stores by 2032. The chain has a similar concept to Chipotle, which has become one of the most incredible restaurant stocks to own. Cava features healthy, fresh, customizable dishes like sandwiches and bowls with a Mediterranean spin. It's fast-casual at its best, featuring upscale food at prices its customers can afford. The company has demonstrated a fair amount of resilience despite a pressured economy, and there's every reason to expect that it can keep it up, especially as inflation moderates and interest rates go down. There's one big problem with Cava stock, and that's its valuation. As Cava comes through on its premise, investors find it irresistible and keep pushing up the price. Cava stock is up 188% this year and trades at the fantastic forward one-year P/E ratio of 250. That's a nosebleed valuation that's unusual for a non-tech stock. I keep saying Cava is too expensive, and so far, it keeps rising anyway. Does that mean it will eventually burst? Possibly. You have to have a strong stomach for risk to buy at this price, but over time, Cava could grow into its valuation and be a standout stock. Dutch Bros is making similar waves in the coffee world. It's been around for decades as a small, Oregon-based chain with local stores, but it is undergoing a countrywide expansion with the goal of opening 4,000 stores over the next 10 to 15 years, up from 912 at the end of the second quarter. What makes Dutch Bros stand out is its relaxed and friendly culture, in contrast with Starbucks' more urban feel. Along with that vibe, Dutch Bros offers its own take on beverage innovation, with signature, bold drinks (and names) and a focus on customer service. Its prices are also more in line with a down-to-earth atmosphere, meaning its products are cheaper than Starbucks. So far, the concept is transferring well to different regions across the country. It's still concentrated in the West, but it's expanding across states in the South and is currently open in 18 states. Dutch Bros is reporting high growth, which came in at 30% year over year in the second quarter. This was mostly driven by new stores, 30 in the quarter, but same-store sales are making a comeback and increased 4.1% year over year. As Dutch Bros gets is name out and establishes a strong presence in some of its new regions, and with tailwinds from lower interest rates, that number is likely to get higher. As Dutch Bros scales, it's becoming increasingly profitable. Net income increased from $9.7 million last year to $22.2 million this year in the second quarter. The company's best growth may still be ahead. It's been testing a pilot program for mobile ordering at some of its locations, and it's getting ready to roll it out throughout its business by the end of the year. Married with a robust loyalty program, the program could boost sales to a new degree. Dutch Bros is surprisingly cheap for a high-growth stock, trading at a price-to-sales ratio of 2.3 and a forward P/E of 66. It looks like it could be a strong addition to a growth portfolio right now.

(NYSE:CAVA): ‘One Of The Great New Concepts’","We recently published an article titled, Jim Cramer is Talking About These 12 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where CAVA Group, Inc. (NYSE:CAVA) stands against the other stocks that Jim Cramer has talked about. During September 30’s episode of Mad Money, CNBC’s Jim Cramer delved into the previous three months and the market’s events. He identified some positive developments amidst the turbulence in the market. Cramer highlighted that Dow inched up 17%, the S&P 500 went up 42% while Nasdaq gained 38% during the months. He remarked, “For once, good news was actually good news and interesting.” He went on to say that miracles still happened in the stock market’s third quarter. He pointed out that July, August, and September yielded remarkable returns, even highlighting the typically troublesome month of September, which saw the broader market rising significantly. Cramer elaborated on the lead-up to the Federal Reserve’s decision to cut rates by 50 basis points. He characterized the economic landscape as having “no landing at all,” explaining that the economy continued to grow, inflation decreased, and unemployment ticked up. He suggested that the central bank laid the groundwork for a significant rate cut, which was the reason that there was no panic on Wall Street after the cut. The former hedge fund manager also praised Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for achieving the challenging feat of a double rate cut without shocking the markets. Moving on, Cramer talked about how the market’s breadth expanded as well, with many sectors gaining traction beyond the dominant Magnificent Seven tech stocks. He noted that a variety of industries, including banks, utilities, retail, healthcare, housing, and transportation, enjoyed their moment in the spotlight. As for the upcoming election, he referenced Michael Cembalest of J.P. Morgan Asset Management, who described it as “the most polarized election in 100 years.” Cramer observed that, despite the political drama surrounding the elections, Wall Street remained largely unfazed, even in response to significant events like Vice President Kamala Harris potentially replacing President Biden on the Democratic ticket and the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump. Cramer also highlighted a shift in the housing market, pointing out the first signs of relief from formerly soaring inflation figures. He suggested that an increase in available homes could be the breakthrough needed to address this intractable asset class that has resisted price declines.                    ",

Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings. We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises. The Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure. The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Texas Roadhouse (TXRH) holds a Zacks Rank #2 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $1.34 a share 28 days away from its upcoming earnings release on October 24, 2024. By taking the percentage difference between the $1.34 Most Accurate Estimate and the $1.32 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Texas Roadhouse has an Earnings ESP of 1.71%. TXRH is part of a big group of Retail-Wholesale stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Cava Group (CAVA) as well. Cava Group is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on November 5, 2024. CAVA's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $0.11 a share 40 days from its next earnings release. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Cava Group is $0.11, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 4.06%. Because both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, TXRH and CAVA could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports. Use the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

(CAVA) the Best Performing Stock in 2024?,"We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Performing Stocks in 2024. In this article, we are going to take a look at where CAVA Group Inc. (NYSE:CAVA) stands against the other great-performing stocks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has recently made headlines by closing above the 42,000 mark for the first time, a significant milestone that reflects a surge in investor confidence following a substantial interest rate cut by the Fed. This momentous achievement occurred on September 19, when the Dow jumped over 500 points, closing at 42,063.36. This rise was part of a broader trend in the stock market, with major indices experiencing overall gains throughout the week, largely fueled by optimism surrounding the Fed's decision to lower interest rates by 0.5%. On September 21, Edward Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research, while acknowledging that the market tends to keep rising, also discussed the warning signs of a melt-up, in the context of the markets' response to the September rate cut on CNBC's ‘Closing Bell’. He doubted the necessity of such a large rate cut, suggesting that the economy is currently growing at about 3% year-over-year and could potentially grow even faster. Yardeni noted that while productivity gains are expected to be more pronounced shortly, he would have preferred to see the market stabilize for a while instead of continuing its upward trajectory. Yardeni provided his forecast for the market's potential growth. In his base case scenario, he predicted that the Dow could reach 5,800 possibly by next week. However, he also entertained an alternative scenario where the market might exceed 6,000 before experiencing a correction. Still, he does not foresee a bear market as a recession is unlikely. While discussing investment strategies, Yardeni highlighted that with small-cap and mid-cap stocks showing signs of improvement in valuations, there is an indication that investors should consider diversifying their portfolios beyond large-cap stocks. However, concerns remain regarding mid-cap earnings, which have not shown significant growth recently. Lower interest rates might eventually provide some uplift to these earnings. Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee has indicated that many more rate cuts may be necessary over the next year due to signs of weakness in the manufacturing sector. CNBC's Rick Santelli, who was reporting on September 23, noted that while manufacturing has faced challenges, there are indications it might be recovering slightly, as evidenced by a recent production increase of 0.8%. He referenced comments from Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who stated that the economy is experiencing strong growth and robust consumer spending, which he believed contradicted the concerns raised by Goolsbee. Santelli pointed out that the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently at all-time highs, suggesting that market sentiment remains positive despite underlying economic weaknesses. Further discussing the economic landscape, he remarked on the currency markets, noting that the US dollar has fallen to its lowest level since March 2022. In contrast, the euro has reached its strongest level since April 2022. This shift in currency dynamics reflects broader economic trends, with Santelli suggesting that Germany's economic situation appears significantly weakened compared to its previous state. On the topic of interest rates, Santelli reported that since Tuesday's market close and following the Fed's easing on Wednesday, two-year note yields have decreased by 3 basis points, while ten-year note yields have increased by ~9 basis points. He emphasized the importance of monitoring these changes closely as they could indicate shifting investor sentiment regarding future economic conditions. While Santelli's discussion underscores a complex economic environment where mixed signals from various sectors create uncertainty, the Dow continues to hover around its record highs and investor sentiment remains cautiously optimistic. Market participants are closely monitoring economic indicators and Fed policies to capture future trends. In this context, we're here with a list of the 10 best-performing stocks in 2024.

(CAVA): Mediterranean Marvel or Short Sellers’ Nightmare?,"We recently published a list of 10 Worst Booming Stocks to Buy According to Short Sellers. In this article, we are going to take a look at where CAVA Group Inc. (NYSE:CAVA) stands against other worst booming stocks to buy according to short sellers. September has historically been one of the worst months for US stocks. Considering this and the performance of big tech, particularly AI stocks, in the first week of the month, many investors have been shocked by the performance of the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite Index in the second week of September. Both indices showcased their best performance this year during this week, and both were up for five days in a row. So, it’s not surprising that many investors are confused about what this means and how this even came about in the first place. According to Tom Lee, Co-founder and Managing Partner at Fundstrat Global Advisors, this is the type of performance investors can expect to see over the next eight weeks up to Election Day – and perhaps even for a couple of weeks after that. With the much-awaited Fed meeting also coming up next week, Lee expects more support especially since we already have enough reason to believe that the Fed is going to make some cuts. According to Lee, with the inflation data coming in better than before and with the labor markets needing more support, the Fed’s actions will give the markets more confidence. This will translate into stocks trading well in the upcoming weeks. Lee noted that, at least for the next 12 months, investors should be more confident about the markets and their performance. The potential rate cut is not the only reason for this. Another positive factor is the upcoming election – according to Lee, historically, the markets have always performed well in the months coming after an election. This past trend is making the November-December period also look good for stocks in the US. Lee also commented that the policies of both Presidential candidates are good enough for the markets to do well in 2025 as well. So, even if investors see a little more turbulence, the long-term expectations for the market seem largely positive. In terms of what stocks investors should be looking at in this new environment, Lee noted that the general rule for any investor should be to buy the best companies in any area first. These would be the companies that are able to beat any type of cycle and promise high returns to their shareholders, basically blue chip stocks. At the same time, Lee expects that when the Fed moves rates back toward neutral, cyclical and small-cap stocks will also benefit immensely from the tailwinds created by this move. Because of this, Lee expects small-caps to do really well in the next 12 months. These insights have highlighted that the markets are now on an upward growth trajectory, and we’ve been seeing a lot of stocks generate immense returns because of this. However, many such booming stocks are being relentlessly shorted, which may brew confusion among investors about which companies to buy now. We’ve thus compiled a list of some booming stocks that short sellers consider to be the worst players in the market and explained whether you should consider buying them or not. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

(NYSE:CAVA) is a consumer discretionary player that owns and operates a chain of restaurants under the CAVA brand. It is based in Washington, DC. This company has been working on expanding its reach in the US, for which it opened 18 new locations during the second quarter. The new locations have helped CAVA Group Inc. (NYSE:CAVA) boost its overall sales, which rose by over 14% for the quarter. While many investors have been skeptical about restaurant stocks since they usually struggle with profitability, CAVA Group Inc. (NYSE:CAVA) has been working hard not to live up to this general reputation. In the second quarter alone, the company’s profit margin was about 27%. A major reason why CAVA Group Inc. (NYSE:CAVA) has been able to perform better than other restaurant stocks this year is its value proposition. The company offers quality food at affordable prices, and the cuisine it serves – Mediterranean – is also more differentiated than your typical restaurants. CAVA Group Inc. (NYSE:CAVA) has also been benefiting immensely from its new market entry into Chicago, which has been the strongest market entry for the company in its history.

This highlights the company’s intrinsic value and why it should be considered a worthwhile investment. Next Century Growth Investors, LLC mentioned CAVA Group Inc.

CAVA currently owns and operates >300 stores, and the company targets a 15% plus new store growth rate. The intermediate goal is to have 1,000 stores by 2032 with plenty of opportunity to grow beyond that level. The company already delivers solid restaurant level margins >20% and they believe 3-5% same store sales growth is achievable over time.

(NYSE:CAVA) Improve Its Returns?","While some investors are already well versed in financial metrics (hat tip), this article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE) and why it is important. To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand CAVA Group, Inc. (NYSE:CAVA). Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. Check out our latest analysis for CAVA Group The formula for return on equity is: Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity So, based on the above formula, the ROE for CAVA Group is: 7.2% = US$43m ÷ US$595m (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2024). The 'return' is the yearly profit. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.07 in profit. One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. If you look at the image below, you can see CAVA Group has a lower ROE than the average (16%) in the Hospitality industry classification. That's not what we like to see. That being said, a low ROE is not always a bad thing, especially if the company has low leverage as this still leaves room for improvement if the company were to take on more debt. When a company has low ROE but high debt levels, we would be cautious as the risk involved is too high. Companies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same. Shareholders will be pleased to learn that CAVA Group has not one iota of net debt! So although its ROE isn't that impressive, we shouldn't judge it harshly on that metric, because it didn't use debt. At the end of the day, when a company has zero debt, it is in a better position to take future growth opportunities.    ",

Buy Cava Instead.,"Nothing ever repeats itself perfectly on Wall Street, but there are some things that rhyme. So if you are looking at Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG) and thinking that you missed out on the restaurant's early growth years, don't fret. Cava Group (NYSE: CAVA) looks like it might be heading on a similar trajectory, just with a slightly different food concept. Here's what you need to know. One of the key strengths of Chipotle is its assembly line preparation approach. It's quite simple, actually. In the background guests see the kitchen, where food is being freshly prepared. That food is then put into containers that sit behind a glass counter. Customers then walk along the counter choosing what they want in their food. The options are limited in one way, but the variety of food outcomes is broad and determined by the customer. To suggest that this highly personalized food preparation approach is a hit with customers is an understatement. The growth of Chipotle is clear evidence of its popularity. The brand opened in 1993 with a single location. By the end of 2015 it had roughly 2,000 restaurants. And by the end of the second quarter of 2024 it had over 3,500 shops. As for financial results, well, they've been pretty impressive. Over the past decade revenues have grown at nearly 12% a year on an annualized basis. Earnings have expanded at a 15.5% annualized clip over that same span. That's pretty incredible performance, but not shocking for a popular and fast-growing restaurant brand. Given that backdrop, it shouldn't be too surprising that Chipotle's stock has risen over 6,000% since its initial public offering (IPO). But Cava Group has some important similarities to Chipotle, most notably that the restaurant applies the same assembly line food preparation approach, just with Mediterranean food and not Mexican food. Cava only held its IPO in mid-2023, so it is still a very young company. At the end of its first quarter as a public company it operated just 279 locations. At the end of the second quarter of 2024 it operated 341 restaurants. Like Chipotle, Cava is looking to expand rapidly. Every new location will boost revenues. And as long as management can continue to operate its existing locations at a high level, with same-store sales that stay flat or, even better, grow, new locations will fuel rapid top-line expansion. The bottom line may be a bit more trouble right now, because the company is small and investing heavily in growth. But if the top line keeps expanding, earnings should eventually start to become more reliable. And, likely, start to head higher over time. Basically, once Cava reaches a certain scale, it will be able to self-fund its growth while generating positive earnings. Investors aren't ignorant to the opportunity, having driven Cava's shares up 180% or so since its IPO. However, if you compare Cava to Chipotle, Cava could have years of business growth and stock growth ahead. To be fair, Cava is only going to be interesting to growth-oriented investors. Value types will think it is too expensive and income investors will be turned off by the fact that Cava doesn't pay a dividend. Young growth stocks also tend to be volatile, so that's something else to consider before you jump aboard. However, if you are a growth investor with a strong constitution, Cava could be the perfect stock for you if you feel like you missed out on Chipotle's huge early growth years. You can't just look at Chipotle and extrapolate that company's performance to Cava, no matter how similar the two business concepts happen to be. But it is hard not to see those similarities and, thus, the growth potential that Cava has ahead of it. The key is to make sure that Cava lives up to the potential, which will mean tracking store openings very closely and keeping tabs on same-store sales, which will give an indication of the health of the existing store fleet. If Cava can keep opening new stores while operating existing locations at a high level, Wall Street will likely reward the stock with a rising stock price. That's probably worth the risk if you feel like you've missed out on Chipotle, although the ride could be bumpy along the way.

These results would represent year-over-year changes of +104.76% and +28.8%, respectively.

Consequently, upward revisions in estimates express analysts' positivity towards the company's business operations and its ability to generate profits. Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model. Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988.

(CAVA) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know","Cava Group (CAVA) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term. Shares of this Mediterranean restaurant chain have returned +20.8% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.3% change. The Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry, to which Cava belongs, has gained 3.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term? Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision. Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock. We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements. Cava is expected to post earnings of $0.11 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +83.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +19.4%. For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $0.43 points to a change of +104.8% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +21.6%. For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $0.51 indicates a change of +18.9% from what Cava is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +7.6%. With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Cava.               ",

(CAVA),"We recently compiled a list titled Jim Cramer’s Ultimate Stock Picks: 10 Hot Stocks to Consider. In this article, we will look at where CAVA Group Inc. (NYSE:CAVA) ranks among Jim Cramer's 10 hot stocks to consider. In a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer emphasized the unexpected strength in the market, pointing out that many companies are doing better than Wall Street realizes. He suggests that investors should stop second-guessing these companies every time negative news surfaces. Cramer praises the excellent management and execution by CEOs, which he feels often goes unappreciated. “Suddenly, all is forgiven, or if not all, then at least most. I’m talking about the incredible resilience in this market, buoyed by a recognition that many companies are simply better than Wall Street gives them credit for. We need to stop turning against them every time there’s a seemingly bad data point. Every day I come to work, I’m dazzled by the resourcefulness of executives who do their best to create value for you, the shareholder. Lots of stocks went up on days like today when the Dow advanced 335 points, the S&P gained 75%, and the NASDAQ jumped 1.0%, all thanks to good management and excellent execution that often goes unnoticed.” Jim Cramer acknowledges that while some CEOs might warrant skepticism, many are truly exceptional and deserve more recognition for their efforts. He criticizes the overemphasis on short-term economic indicators, arguing that great companies stay focused and aren’t thrown off by minor fluctuations. “Listen, I’m not a pushover. I can hit CEOs with tough questions when needed, some of them deserve skepticism and scorn. But there are also plenty of brilliant, hardworking CEOs with incredible teams, and you ignore their hustle at your own peril. This often gets lost in the shuffle when we’re focused on the parlor game of guessing the Fed’s next move, a quarter point, half a point, quarter, half. You know what I say? Let’s get serious. Terrific companies don’t get caught up in that quarter-half shuffle.” Cramer highlights Kroger CEO Rodney McMullen as an example of strong leadership. Despite facing challenges like opposition to its acquisition of Albertsons and a tough economic climate, McMullen has successfully managed to keep food costs down. Through strategies such as an effective loyalty program and improvements to regional stores, the company has performed well. After a strong earnings report, the stock rose more than 7%, reflecting a successful turnaround. “CEO Rodney McMullen has managed to keep food costs down and deliver fantastic numbers, all while maintaining an expensive, unionized labor force in a very uncertain commodity environment. How? The company confounded critics by developing a superior loyalty program, regionalizing their stores, and creating some of the best private-label products out there, second only to Costco. Food is still expensive, but cooking at home is far cheaper than dining out. McMullen tells us that consumers are no longer flush with cash, especially his most budget-conscious clientele. He notes, “Budget-conscious customers are buying more at the beginning of the month to stock up on essentials, and as the month progresses, they become more cautious with their spending.”                  ",

Well, that obviously depends on how much money a person is willing to invest. Cava trades at about $117 per share, as of this writing. Let's say that an investor buys 7,700 shares. In this scenario, those shares will cost a whopping $900,000. But if it goes up to $130 per share (a meager 11% gain), the stake would be worth $1 million. Most investors don't have $900,000 lying around -- even a $10,000 investment is significant for many. For $10,000, one could purchase about 85 shares of Cava. But Cava stock would need to go up a whopping 100 times in value for it to be a millionaire-maker in this scenario. In asking whether Cava stock is a millionaire-maker, what we're really asking is by how much can shares rise over the long term? My answer is that Cava stock will stay far away from hundred-bagger territory, as I'll explain. Cava is a small Mediterranean fast-casual restaurant chain of 341 locations, offering different items on its menu that include lamb, falafel, and feta cheese. Differentiation can help it stand out, and the company indeed appears to getting consumers' attention. Same-store sales (or same restaurant sales in this case) measure sales at Cava locations that have been open for a while. The company opened 18 new locations in the second quarter of 2024, which obviously boosts overall sales. But measuring same-store sales can show whether the brand is growing in popularity where locations have been open for at least a year. For Cava, its second-quarter same-store sales were up more than 14%. For perspective, really any positive number is seen as a good thing. Double-digit growth is seen as a great thing. Restaurant stocks usually struggle with profitability, but Cava is making it look easy. At the restaurant level, its Q2 profit margin was almost 27%. Even after accounting for other corporate expenses, the company still had a net profit margin of 7% in the first half of 2024, which is quite strong. With growth and profits, Cava is a great restaurant business. As of this writing, Cava has a market capitalization of over $13 billion. Increasing 100 times in value would push it into the trillion-dollar club, which is unreasonable for a restaurant concept, no matter how promising it is. For perspective, McDonald's is the most valuable restaurant today, with a market cap of about $200 billion. I can't see Cava being worth more than five McDonald's in my lifetime.                ",

The following companies would make great stocks to hold over the next few decades to protect and build wealth for a happy retirement. Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ: COST) is a no-brainer stock to hold for the long term. The business operates on razor-thin margins, which keeps competitors at bay. Costco operates on such low margins that half of its operating profit is generated from its annual membership fees. This allows the company to sell a range of quality goods, including high-end jewelry, at discounted prices. Costco does discount retail better than anyone, which is the main source of its competitive advantage. It only stocks items that it can sell quickly to keep inventory turnover up. This instills a loyal customer base, as noted by its 90%-plus membership renewal rates. With inflation starting to cool, the business is seeing improving sales trends. In the May-ending fiscal third quarter, Costco reported an increase in comparable store sales of 6.5%, excluding changes in gas prices and currency. But the 7.2% increase in the month of July suggests sales are accelerating. Longer-term, Costco still has tremendous growth potential. The company plans to open new warehouses in Japan and Korea, but it's also finding ways to reach new customers in the U.S. through services like Uber Eats. Costco recently expanded the partnership with Uber to include more states and international countries, which could become an important customer acquisition tool. Costco stock is up 62% over the last 12 months and trades at a high price-to-earnings ratio relative to expected earnings growth, but investors who regularly buy shares, or dollar-cost average, can profit off Costco's future growth without worrying about whether the stock is too expensive right now. The stock should be worth a lot more in 20 years than it is today. Investors who park some cash in Cava Group (NYSE: CAVA) stock could see phenomenal returns over the next 20 years. Its Mediterranean-focused menu is standing out in an industry that is dominated by burgers and fries. The stock has returned 160% over the last year, but it's just getting started. Despite a sluggish consumer spending environment, Cava posted an impressive 14% year-over-year increase in comparable sales last quarter. That helped push its total revenue up 35% over the year-ago quarter. Importantly, Cava is already earning healthy margins to fuel shareholder returns. Restaurant-level profit margins are expected to come in at over 24% in 2024. In the second quarter, Cava's net income tripled year over year to $19.7 million on $231 million of revenue. Further expansion in Cava's relatively small restaurant base will drive higher profits and shareholder returns.          ",

Strong financial results for second-quarter 2024 and a corresponding enthusiastic response from Wall Street boosted the stock to an all-time high. But a subsequent stock sale caused a modest pullback. On Aug. 22, Cava reported Q2 financial results, and it was all good news for shareholders. Its Q2 revenue was up an astounding 35% from the same quarter of 2023. It also turned in its highest quarterly profit margin ever at 8.5%. There were other high points in the Q2 report as well. With strong financial results, Wall Street sang Cava's praises. Many analysts increased their price targets for the stock -- in other words, after looking at the numbers, these investing professionals decided the upside is higher than they previously thought. This boosted general investor sentiment. However, something late in the month threw a little cold water on all this. Several insiders sold shares, including co-founder and CEO Brett Schulman, who sold about 200,000 shares on Aug. 26. When insiders sell, it can indicate that the stock is overvalued, and it's why Cava stock pulled back from its all-time high. I wouldn't necessarily push the panic button if I were a Cava shareholder. For founders, growing a business and taking it public is quite the journey. Moreover, it can a be low-income journey. Therefore, it's understandable that insiders might cash in on some shares and finally reap some of the reward of the business' success. That said, insiders don't seem to sell as much when a stock is undervalued. And investors might already be a little jumpy when it comes to Cava's valuation. As of this writing, it trades at 16 times sales. That's not necessarily unheard of for a restaurant stock. But it's unusual for a company like Cava, which uses a company-owned model instead of a franchised model. Moreover, all the company's restaurant's locations are leased -- it doesn't own real estate. By not even owning real estate, one would expect a lower valuation for Cava than what it fetches right now. In my opinion, Cava is both a great business and an overvalued stock. These two realities could motivate different responses for different investors. For investors who might have already been planning to sell Cava stock in 2024, I think today's valuation offers a great price. For investors with no intention of selling, Cava is still a great business, and Q2 proved it more than ever. And the more time a quality business has, the less valuation tends to matter. Understand that the stock could underperform for a time if its valuation drops in the near term. But if Cava keeps executing as it has, it can grow past its valuation risk.        ",

That's a key reason why Cava Group (NYSE: CAVA) is often seen as the next Chipotle, as the fast-growing business could have a lot of upside given its relatively modest $13 billion valuation. Cava Group's sales are growing by double digits, and it's opening more restaurants. At the same time, it's also experiencing strong profit growth. All in all, the business is doing incredibly well even under less-than-ideal economic conditions. But with its stock already amassing some significant gains this year, has its valuation become too rich for it to still be a good investment right now? What often appeals to growth investors about Cava as an investment is the company's ability to continually generate strong results. The Mediterranean fast-casual restaurant chain has many expansion opportunities, and its existing locations are also doing well and posting strong organic growth. Last month, the company posted its second-quarter numbers for the period ending July 14. Sales totaled $233.5 million, rising by an impressive 35% year over year. Same-restaurant sales increased by 14.4%, with traffic-related growth accounting for the bulk of that increase (9.5%). The restaurant chain also launched a new grilled steak option, which it believes helped draw in more customers. Not only did the company show impressive top-line growth, its profits also tripled, soaring from $6.5 million in the prior-year period to $19.7 million for the current quarter. Given its strong results, it's no surprise investors have been buying up the stock, as it is one of the fastest-growing restaurant chains to invest in today. While there's no doubt Cava has been doing well, the question is whether the stock's rapid increase in price has made it too expensive and put it at too high a premium. Since the start of the year, shares of Cava are up 165%, and that's with a recent pullback. That's a far better return than the S&P 500 and the 18% gains it has generated over the same time frame. The consensus analyst price target for Cava is just under $107, which suggests that the restaurant stock has already climbed to a higher valuation than where analysts expected it would have gone in the short run. Here's how Cava stock is valued based on some key metrics investors might consider when buying a stock: Price-to-earnings ratio: 633 Forward price-to-earnings ratio: 455 Price-to-sales ratio: 16 Price-to-book ratio: 22 Based on all these metrics, Cava appears to be trading at an extremely high premium. While that doesn't necessarily mean that it can't still generate a good return for investors, a high valuation could make it harder to do so, as it could turn away many investors. Cava is an attractive growth stock, but it comes at too high a premium for it to be worth buying today, as its share price has arguably accelerated too fast. Investors may be better off buying other growth stocks instead. Amid a slowdown in the economy and potentially worsening growth rates, a high-priced investment such as Cava could become vulnerable and have a lot of room to decline due to its valuation. While it can still grow and possibly generate positive returns, it's by no means a no-brainer buy at its current price. I would hold off on buying the stock, despite its strong earnings numbers.

The Mediterranean-style restaurant chain is growing like a wildfire while generating positive bottom-line profits. I understand why many investors are excited about this thrilling growth story, sending Cava's stock price 152% higher in the last 52 weeks. But I'm not going anywhere near the ""buy"" button for Cava stock in the foreseeable future. This soaring stock is flying too close to the sun and looks overdue for a sharp price correction. That's life in the risky and competitive restaurant industry. Again, I get it. Cava opened 62 net new restaurants over the last year, including 18 in the recently reported second quarter. Menu prices are up by 4.9% in the same span in order to tamp down inflation-based increases in ingredient costs, and foot traffic per store rose by 9.5%. The company generated $19.7 million of net income and $22.7 million in free cash flows in the second quarter. Investors get thrilling growth and an 8% net profit margin in a single package — where do I sign up? That's why Cava's shares are soaring since entering the public stock market in June 2023. Unfortunately, I don't think the business can support these lofty stock prices. That brings me to the uncomfortable bit. Cava's stock is trading at unreasonably high valuation ratios. Yes, it's great to see that the company is profitable but it shouldn't be worth 15 times trailing sales, 308 times earnings, or 1,155 times free cash flows. Those are soaring ratios in any industry, and especially in the ultra-competitive restaurant sector. True giants like McDonald's (NYSE: MCD) and Yum! Brands (NYSE: YUM) come with single-digit price to sales ratios and profit-based valuation multiples in the 20x to 30x range. Even the fast-growing Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG) chain nearly fits that modest valuation profile. Just for fun, let's run Cava through the rigors of a discounted cash flow (DCF) calculation. This valuation method estimates a stock's value based on the amount of cash the underlying business might generate for shareholders in the long run. Using some incredibly generous estimates for Cava's potential cash flow growth, I still get a ""fair value"" estimate of just $5 per share. Yes, it's difficult to squeeze reasonable numbers out of the DCF equation when the cash profits are just above breakeven, but that's kind of my point here. How do you pin a fair price tag on such a risky and barely profitable business? And the ditches of Wall Street are littered with the remains of formerly high-flying restaurant stocks. Many were seen as ""the next Chipotle,"" just like Cava, with ambitious expansion plans to match. In many cases, they ended up stumbling over costly growth plans at the wrong time. Remember Zoës Kitchen, for example? That was another high-growth Mediterranean restaurant concept, opening dozens of new locations per year in its heyday with long-term plans of a nationwide presence. Well, those plans didn't work out and Cava bought what was left of Zoës Kitchen in 2018. Some of its locations have been converted into Cava restaurants and others simply shut down. In all fairness, I'm not terribly keen on restaurant stocks in general. The industry is too packed with rivals, all reaching for the same consumer wallets in different ways. My only exposure to this fracas is Toast (NYSE: TOST), a maker of restaurant management hardware and software designed to save operating costs and improve their efficiency. This industry needs all the cost-saving help it can get. And I'm a long way away from adding any Cava stock to that portfolio. I might reconsider if the unchecked growth continues without resorting to dilutive stock sales or risky debt papers along the way — but even then, only at a much lower valuation. So I wish the best of luck to Cava and its investors, but I'm not even a little bit tempted to own the stock right now. Come back in a few years with sustained growth and a milder share price, and maybe I'll finally reach for that ten-foot pole.

Cava Group (NYSE: CAVA) is one of them. The newly public restaurant chain focused on Mediterranean food is up over 160% so far in 2024 due to investor enthusiasm over its growth potential and the same-store sales growth at its existing restaurants. The stock now has a market cap of $13 billion. There is a lot of hype for what some are calling the next Chipotle Mexican Grill, and that hype is looking increasingly deserved. But is it too late to buy the stock with shares up over 160% this year? Cava Group has a simple strategy: serve fresh Mediterranean-style food at a reasonable price. This includes menu items with falafel, hummus, pita bread, and Greek chicken. With no national brand serving this style of food, Cava sees an opportunity to fill a vacuum, similar to what Mexican food chains have done over the last few decades. So far, it looks like consumers are loving the restaurant concept. Last quarter, Cava revenue grew 35% year over year to $231.4 million. Sales growth was driven by an impressive same-store sales growth of 14.4%, with traffic up 9.5% to boot. This means that more people are visiting existing Cava locations and spending more money. Profits are strong as well, with 26.5% restaurant-level margins last quarter. What makes this even more impressive is the fact that a lot of restaurant brands are struggling at the moment. For example, McDonald's same-store sales have been trending in the wrong direction for several quarters and just flipped to negative. Perhaps a small reason is that more restaurant-goers are switching to healthier options at Cava. With 341 restaurant locations around the United States, Cava believes there is plenty of room to reinvest in the business for many years. It plans to open 54 to 57 restaurants in 2024. If it can add around 60 every year for the next 10 years, Cava will have 1,000 unit locations within a decade. And that is still significantly smaller than Chipotle, which is closing in on 4,000 restaurant locations around the world. Cava locations have an average unit volume (AUV) of $2.7 million. This is solid for a new restaurant concept, but there is still plenty of room for improvement over the next 10 years. If Cava hits 1,000 locations and a $4 million AUV, that is $4 billion in annual revenue 10 years from now with still plenty of room for store expansion thereafter. Trailing-12-month revenue was $845 million. Let's assume Cava hits $4 billion in sales 10 years from now. Assuming a standard consolidated profit margin of 15% for restaurants -- the 26.5% figure above excludes corporate overhead costs -- that equals $600 million in annual profits for Cava in 2034.

This momentum builds off 2023's huge rise. But there's one booming stock that has significantly outperformed the broader index. It has skyrocketed 175% so far in 2024. As if that gain wasn't remarkable enough, this company's shares have even outperformed AI powerhouse Nvidia this year, a business that investors just can't seem to get enough of. But is it too late to buy this monster restaurant stock? Investors might be surprised to learn that the company putting up such impressive gains is Cava (NYSE: CAVA), the operator of Mediterranean-inspired fast-casual restaurants across the country. The company has won over investors excited about its strong financial performance and growth prospects. During the fiscal 2024 second quarter (ended July 14), Cava reported a year-over-year revenue surge of 35.2%. This was driven by a robust same-store sales gain of 14.4%, a clear indication that foot traffic and pricing remain solid despite macro uncertainty. However, the key part of Cava's story is the rapid expansion of the store base. After 18 net new locations were opened in Q2, there are now a total of 341. Cava says the average restaurant rakes in $2.7 million in annual sales volume, with an outstanding restaurant-level earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) margin of 26.5% (this figure excludes corporate expenses). These unit economics aren't too far behind industry leader Chipotle Mexican Grill. The management team has its sights set on a big target. By 2032, the goal is to have 1,000 stores open, translating to a roughly threefold expansion from the size of the current footprint. Revenue is certain to be substantially higher if all goes according to plan. Cava generated $16.1 million in operating income in the last quarter, which was almost triple the total in Q2 2023. Profitability was helped by better leveraging certain expenses. As the business scales up, investors are hoping the bottom line will rise at a faster pace than revenue. After seeing a stock nearly triple in about eight months' time, I don't think anyone would disagree with the assertion that the market is incredibly enthusiastic about Cava's prospects. The momentum is hard to ignore. However, astute investors will focus on the valuation. Cava shares trade in nosebleed territory. If you wanted to buy the stock, you'd be forced to pay a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 270. That's nearly 12 times the S&P 500's valuation and more than five times higher than Chipotle.            ",

The stock market presents these opportunities to investors all the time. You just have to pay attention to what brands people are shopping for more frequently. Here are two fast-growing brands that could make investors a small fortune over the next 20 years. Investors who jumped on board Chipotle Mexican Grill, McDonald's, or Starbucks in their early years of growth are sitting in the catbird seat today. Cava Group (NYSE: CAVA) is the latest high-flying restaurant stock that is worth betting on for the long haul. There are plenty of burger, steak, pizza, Italian, Chinese, and Mexican restaurant chains, but there are not many establishments in the U.S. with a Mediterranean-focused menu. The cuisine is seen as a healthy and sophisticated alternative in a sea of the same old options. This is why Cava has experienced impressive customer traffic this year in a challenging consumer spending environment, which has driven double-digit increases in same-store sales. Strong growth has sent the stock up 185% over the last year, but it's not too late to buy it. Cava's 35% year-over-year revenue growth is on par with Chipotle's growth in its early years as a public company. A $10,000 investment in Chipotle in 2006 would have grown to $634,000 today, and Cava is following a similar growth path. Cava has a huge runway of growth. Its quarterly revenue of $231 million is a fraction of Chipotle's $2.9 billion. It took Chipotle almost two decades to expand to its current size. Cava is currently in 25 U.S. states and just opened in Chicago with the strongest customer response the business has seen to date. Importantly, Cava is growing its store base at a rate of about 8% to 9% per year, but management is expanding in a disciplined manner. It posted a net profit of $19 million last quarter. The company will become more profitable as it expands across the U.S., and that should support more new highs for Cava stock. The athletic apparel industry has been another ripe market for monster winners in the stock market. A $10,000 investment in Nike 44 years ago would now be worth $7.7 million with dividends reinvested. Investors might have a second crack at gains like this, because On Holding (NYSE: ONON) is currently growing at a similar rate to Nike in the 1980s. On is one of the hottest apparel brands right now. There were 66 On-sponsored athletes at the Paris Olympics this year. Like Nike, On generates most of its sales from performance shoes, a segment that grew 28% year over year on a constant-currency basis last quarter.           ",

In Cava's (NYSE: CAVA) case, the Mediterranean food chain might be the exception. The stock is up over 26% in the last five days, thanks to a stellar second-quarter earnings report. I see this chain as the new Chipotle (NYSE: CMG) with great growth potential. Let's start with the revenue growth. This is, after all, what everyone is looking for in a growth-focused company like Cava. The company managed to report revenue growth of 35.2% year over year in the second quarter to $231.4 million. How often do you see that level of growth? Same-restaurant sales increased 14.4%, while restaurant-level profit improved 37.3% year over year. In all, earnings of $0.17 per share outpaced expectations of $0.13. Cava also increased its guidance for fiscal 2024. Same-restaurant sales are now expected to grow 8.5% to 9.5% compared to previous guidance of 4.5% to 6.5%. One of the big announcements here has been the introduction of grilled steak to menus, which the company announced has been outperforming expectations. Cava's performance is in contrast to that of many restaurant chains, which have struggled to increase traffic with a more fickle consumer base. McDonald's, for instance, saw same-store sales fall 1% in its most recent quarter, compared to Cava's 14.4% gain. Over the last year, this stock has delivered 183% in share price gains, compared to the S&P 500's return of 27.5%. The performance has been amazing. The question now becomes: Can it continue? This is an easy stock to knock on an earnings basis. Cava is trading at over 900 times earnings based on 2023 diluted earnings results of $0.12 per share and 513 times full-year analyst estimates for 2024 of $0.23 per share. Despite the expensive nature of the stock, I still like Cava over the long term. Traffic increased 9.5% during the quarter, which again is in contrast to what was a weaker quarter for restaurants. The company keeps beating expectations, meaning current estimates for the future aren't necessarily accurate. Additionally, it is gaining clear momentum in an area of cuisine that hasn't been tackled in this way before. The way the company is combining Mediterranean fare with a Chipotle-like business structure leads me to believe the story of surprises to the upside can continue, and investors have made it clear that they're willing to put up with the high premiums on the stock if Cava outpaces expectations. With under 400 current locations, Cava has a lot of growing to do compared to a similar enterprise like Chipotle, which has over 3,000 stores. Cava plans to open 54 to 57 new restaurants for the full year, meaning we're going to see those top-line numbers continue to expand with the potential for unseen upside. In a restaurant sector seeing weaker traffic and same-store sales, I like the idea of sticking with the name that has momentum in the industry.

But great businesses can withstand the test of time and provide meaningful portfolio returns. Concerns about the U.S. economy, its impact on the global economy, and the trickle-down impact of inflation on businesses across industries are legitimate. At the same time, if you're investing your cash into excellent companies and intend to hold on to your positions for years at a time, these short-term movements needn't deter you from your overarching financial goals. On that note, here are two monster growth stocks to consider adding to your portfolio right now. AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV) has dealt with some short-term headwinds in recent quarters due to the loss of patent exclusivity on Humira. The drug was once the world's top-selling drug and the crown jewel of this healthcare company's portfolio. While the entry of generics into the market has certainly driven a decline in Humira sales, AbbVie has other winners in its portfolio that are slowly but surely offsetting the outcome of these changes. Bear in mind, pharmaceutical companies tend to be far less cyclical than other businesses. However, they do endure changing business cycles as new drugs are developed and approved, and older, top-selling drugs give way to competition. The average period of patient exclusivity for newly approved drugs is around 12 years, but this can vary based on the specific product in question. AbbVie delayed patent expiration on Humira for years, eventually extending its patent exclusivity period to around two decades before it was finally forced to contend with the impact of biosimilars. Fast-forward to the second quarter of 2024, and the impact of AbbVie's broad portfolio of other blockbuster drugs is taking hold despite waning sales of Humira, driving revenue and profits upward. Worldwide net revenue in the three-month period totaled $14.5 billion, up approximately 4% from one year ago, a healthy increase for a business at its level of maturity. This performance was driven by robust growth in its oncology and neuroscience drug portfolios of 11% and 15%, respectively. Blockbuster immunology drugs like Skryizi and Rinvoq, which saw revenue rise by respective rates of 45% and 56% in the quarter from the year-ago period, were also heavy hitters here. The company is very profitable. In the first half of 2024, AbbVie brought in net earnings of approximately $2.8 billion, a 21% increase from the first half of 2023. And over the trailing 12 months, AbbVie has brought in operating cash flow of about $19 billion with free cash flow in the ballpark of $20 billion.                 ",

It operates a similar model of fast-casual restaurants offering healthy, fresh food, with its Mediterranean-style fare providing a different spin on the concept. Cava is meeting investor expectations, and just over a year into being a public company, it's heading in the right direction. Should Chipotle investors take a look? Here are three things to think about before opening a position in either stock. As a young company, Cava's growing at a rapid pace. It's taking a page from the Chipotle playbook, but since Chipotle is much more mature, the Mexican food chain's growth isn't quite as high. Company Q2 2024 Sales Growth (YoY) Q2 2024 Comps Growth (YoY) Q2 2024 EPS Q2 2024 EPS Growth (YoY) Restaurant-Level Profit Margin Cava 35.2% 14.4% $0.17 (22%) 26.5% Chipotle 18.2% 11.1% $0.33 32% 28.9% Data sources: Cava and Chipotle quarterly filings. EPS = earnings per share. YoY = year over year. Cava's total sales growth rate was almost double Chipotle's, but its comparable sales growth was only a tad higher. Chipotle reliably delivers steady double-digit percentage growth, even if that's at a lower rate than a new competitor, and its comparable sales growth is outstanding. So is its profitability. You might think Cava has a longer runway because it's young and has only 341 stores. However, its management team sees the opportunity to expand the chain to a total of about 1,000 stores over the eight or so next years. Chipotle, by contrast, has its model down pat and a proven track record of popularity, and it plans to double its store count in North America to 7,000. Cava's opportunity percentage-wise may be higher, but its overall opportunity still appears smaller in comparison. In the second quarter, Cava opened 18 stores and plans to open at least 54 for the full year. Chipotle opened 52 stores just in the quarter and plans for about 300 for the year. Chipotle is also expanding internationally. Cava may follow that strategy at some point if all goes well, but overseas markets are not even on its radar yet. The problem with hot stocks is that they often get hot before the average investor even hears about them. Initial public offering (IPO) stocks often start out these days at ridiculous valuations, making them non-starters for a disciplined retail investor. Even when they do continue to rise after that initial surge, it's usually a prelude to an eventual fall; these stocks simply can't support their unreasonable valuations for too long. In that context, consider Cava, which is up more than 200% since its IPO just over a year ago. That's clearly a Cava issue, but Chipotle stock isn't cheap either, although it has delivered phenomenal gains for investors who have held on. Chipotle stock is down since June, and it has wobbled a bit since the news broke a couple of weeks ago that superstar Chief Executive Officer Brian Niccol is leaving it to lead Starbucks. At the current price, Cava stock just does not look compelling. For all of its great performance and potential, I don't think it can sustain this kind of valuation for long. Is there a chance that it will keep up this streak and hold onto this valuation? There is -- but the share price has absolutely no wiggle room for any mistakes. Cava stock surged higher after the excellent second-quarter results, and it will plunge if there's any hint of weakness in the business. That's how it usually works with hyped-up stocks. Risk-tolerant investors might be more interested in Cava stock, but most investors should see this as an opportunity to buy Chitpotle's reliable market-beating stock on the dip.

Are They Better Buys Than the AI Leader?,"Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been the star of the stock market this year. The artificial intelligence (AI) chip specialist has wowed investors with triple-digit revenue growth and an even faster surge on the bottom line as it drives the generative AI revolution forward. No other stock in history has added trillions of dollars in market value so fast, and Nvidia even briefly became the most valuable company in the world, topping Apple and Microsoft. Year to date, Nvidia stock has surged 160% -- certainly, an impressive run. Yet, some stocks have actually beaten the tech powerhouse this year. Keep reading below to see three of them, and whether they can continue to outperform Nvidia. Cava Group (NYSE: CAVA) is one of the most impressive restaurant stocks to emerge on the market in years, arguably since Chipotle Mexican Grill. The founder of Panera Bread, Ron Shaich, was an early investor and serves as chair of the board, helping to steer the fast-casual chain toward success. Cava has also adopted a Chipotle-like menu but with Mediterranean food and a similar minimalist industrial store design. The concept is clearly resonating with customers, according to its results. In the second quarter, Cava reported comparable sales growth of 14.4%, driven by a 9.5% jump in traffic, showing that the concept is catching on. Its average unit volumes, meaning the average annual revenue per restaurant, improved to $2.7 billion, approaching Chipotle's at $3.1 billion. Cava's restaurant-level profit margin is similarly impressive at 26.5% in the most recent quarter, which compares to 28.9% at Chipotle. Cava's bottom-line profits are also jumping as net income tripled in the second quarter to $19.7 million. The chain is still small at 341 locations, which should give it a long runway of growth. After the earnings pop last Friday, Cava stock is now 182% this year. Another restaurant chain, Sweetgreen (NYSE: SG), has also been a breakout performer this year as the fast-casual salad chain has surged thanks to strong growth numbers and a low share price at the beginning of the year. Sweetgreen has taken a more circuitous route to its current level than Cava as the stock went public at the peak of the pandemic bubble and then crashed, along with nearly every other growth stock. Since then, the salad slinger has reassured investors of its potential, delivering both impressive growth and improving restaurant-level profits. It's also introduced a robotic kitchen assistant it calls Infinite Kitchen, which the company says is accelerating throughput and saving on labor costs.                      ",

Cava CEO Brett Schulman and CFO Tricia Toliver were among those who disclosed stock sales. The moves came after the restaurant chain's shares soared on its better-than-expected results for the second quarter.  Shares of Cava (CAVA) fell over 5% Tuesday after records showed a major shareholder and several executives sold shares. Cava CEO Brett Schulman sold 201,504 shares worth $24.9 million, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. CFO Tricia Toliver and a trust associated with board member David Bosserman each shed 5,000 shares. Luxembourg-based Artal International S.C.A., Cava’s largest investor, also sold 6 million shares valued at $732 million. It continues to hold about 114 million shares. The moves came after Cava Group shares surged on the company's better-than-expected second-quarter results. Schulman said at the time that gains were boosted by demand for the chain’s new grilled steak dish. Shares of Cava Group closed at an all-time high Monday before turning lower Tuesday. Shares were down nearly 6% at $118.80 in intraday trading Tuesday, though even with Tuesday's losses, they were up over 175% from the start of the year.

Is It Too Late to Buy It?,"Shares of Cava Group (NYSE: CAVA) soared after the operator of fast-casual Mediterranean-themed restaurants saw its same-store sales surge when it reported its fiscal 2024 second-quarter results. The stock price has now nearly tripled this year. Let's delve into Cava's most recent earnings report and see whether the stock still makes a good investment after its huge run this year. Cava saw revenue for its fiscal Q2, which ended July 14, jump 35% to $231.4 million. The growth came from a combination of more locations and strong same-store sales growth. Same-restaurant sales soared 14.4% in Q2. Guest traffic climbed 9.5% year over year and traffic was a huge improvement from the 1.2% decline it saw last quarter. The company's comparable restaurant sales also saw a 4.9% benefit from menu price increases and mix. Even more impressive, Cava was going against difficult comparisons, as a year ago it saw same-restaurant sales growth of 18.8%. The company credited its introduction of grilled steak as a big driver of its increased traffic and sales. It also noted that sales from lower-income households were strong. Meanwhile, Cava ended the quarter with 341 locations compared to 279 at the end of its fiscal Q1 a year ago. It opened 18 new restaurants in the quarter. Its restaurant-level margins (RLM) improved slightly to 26.4% from 26.1% a year ago. This metric helps measure the profitability of its restaurants before corporate costs. The company turned a profit in Q2 of $19.7 million versus $6.5 million a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA, meanwhile, surged 59% year over year to $34.3 million. Cava also generated $48.9 million in operating cash flow in the quarter and $22.7 million in free cash flow. This shows the company is now able to fund its restaurant expansion plans through the cash it generates. Once again, Cava raised its full-year guidance. It is now forecasting same-restaurant sales growth to come in between 8.5% to 9.5%. This is up from earlier projections of 4.5% to 6.5% and original guidance of 3% to 5%. For full-year adjusted EBITDA, Cava management now expects the metric to come in between $109 to $114 million. This is up from its prior outlook of between $100 million to $105 million and original guidance of $86 million to $92 million. Cava also increased its expected restaurant openings for this fiscal year to between 50 to 57, up from earlier guidance of 50 to 54 and an original outlook of 48 to 52 new locations.

That's a huge price gain in a very short period of time, creating some concern that a bubble may have formed. However, investors concerned that all the gains are already priced in shouldn't pass on the stock without giving it a good look. Small restaurant chains like Cava can grow quickly and be very rewarding for investors. Here are three reasons this stock is still a good buy right now. Cava manages Mediterranean-themed fast-casual restaurants. It uses an assembly-line approach that's very similar to Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG) and emphasizes fresh ingredients that help provide consumers with more control over the food they order. The basic business model is a winner, when you consider that Chipotle has grown its version to over 3,500 locations around the world. Indeed, the big long-term appeal here comes directly from the comparison to Chipotle. Cava has only 341 restaurants. That makes it just a fraction of the size of Chipotle and speaks to the long-term potential. Notably, Chipotle still resonates strongly with consumers despite its much larger size. The company's same-store sales rose a massive 11% in the second quarter of 2024. That's a shockingly strong number for a restaurant and is actually up from the first quarter's 7% gain (itself a strong figure), even though other restaurant chains like McDonald's and Darden Restaurants reported sales headwinds in recent quarters. Cava has been performing just as well as Chipotle. Cava's same-store sales results in the second quarter of 2024 were 14.4%, with traffic at its stores up 9.5%. It was a very good quarter, but, to be fair, first-quarter sales growth was just 2.3%, so there was a big uptick in the second quarter. However, 2.3% is actually a respectable number in the restaurant space. In fact, even if Cava only manages to keep same-store sales flat to slightly higher, there's still a lot of potential here. The key for Cava is really balancing its efforts to open new stores against its ability to continue operating its older locations well. Same-store sales tell you about the latter. But that's just maintaining the core. The real growth driver is going to be the new stores that management opens. In the first quarter, Cava opened 14 new locations. That may sound tiny, but it is still a relatively small chain. Those 14 locations, added to the others opened over the past year, pushed the store count up by a huge 22%. That's a lot of growth since each new location brings with it new revenue. In the second quarter, Cava opened 18 new locations, maintaining a year-over-year increase in the store count of 22%.            ",

The remarkable rally in Cava Group’s stock continued after the company was able to exceed Q2 top and bottom line expectations Thursday evening. However, investors may be wondering if they should chase the rally in CAVA which popped +19% on Friday and has now skyrocketed +183% year to date to largely outperform the broader market and Chipotle’s +17%. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Cava Group’s Q2 Results Cava Group posted Q2 sales of $233.5 million which soared 35% from $172.89 million in the comparative quarter. This also exceeded estimates of $222.03 million by 5%. On the bottom line, Q2 EPS of $0.17 dipped from $0.21 per share a year ago but surpassed estimates of $0.13 a share. Other highlights included a 9.5% spike in traffic with Cava Group opening 18 new restaurants including locations in Chicago, in a bid to enter the Midwest market. Notably, Cava Group has exceeded earnings expectations in each of the five quarters it has reported since going public. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Cava Group's Growth Trajectory Based on Zacks estimates, Cava Group’s total sales are now projected to climb 24% in fiscal 2024 to $907.58 million compared to $728.7 million in 2023. Cava Group’s top line is expected to expand another 20% in FY25 to $1.09 billion. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Annual earnings are expected to soar 66% to $0.35 a share versus EPS of $0.21 last year. Plus, FY25 EPS is slated to increase another 34%. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Cava Group’s Valuation Despite its expansive growth trajectory, Cava Group is trading at a far-stretched forward earnings premium of 291.3X although this can be expected for a company that recently went public. However, Cava Group also trades at a noticeable sales premium to the broader market at 12.8X with the S&P 500’s average at 5.4X and Chipotle at 6.4X. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Bottom Line Although Cava Group’s Q2 results helped to reconfirm its expansion, CAVA lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Cava Group is certainly an intriguing long-term investment but there could be better buying opportunities considering its monstrous YTD rally which has stretched the company’s valuation.

Here are some of the biggest U.S. stock movers today: Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) stock rose 4% after the ride-hailing service announced a multiyear partnership with Cruise, a subsidiary of General Motors (NYSE:GM), allowing the latter's self-driving vehicles to be launched on Uber's ride-hailing platform. Ross Stores (NASDAQ:ROST) stock rose 2% after the retailer raised its fiscal 2024 profit forecast and posted second-quarter results above expectations late Thursday, benefiting from demand for its discounted apparel and easing freight costs. Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) stock jumped 11% after the human resource software provider beat market expectations for second-quarter revenue and announced a $1 billion stock buyback plan. CAVA Group (CAVA) stock soared 22% after the fast-casual Mediterranean restaurant chain reported strong second-quarter earnings and revenue, while comparable sales growth and new unit performance also impressed. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock rose 3.2% after Evercore ISI analysts advised investors to buy ahead of the chipmaker’s earnings report for the July quarter, stressing that recent concerns over Blackwell delays are “overdone.” Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) stock rose 1.3% despite the oilfield services firm saying that an unauthorized third party had gained access to some of its systems, and it had launched an internal investigation as well as taken certain systems offline to protect them.

The fast-casual chain, which made a strong market debut in June last year, exceeded second quarter expectations after markets closed on Thursday, and said the system-wide roll out of grilled steak on June 3 generated stronger than expected sales. Many Americans are cutting back on dining out due to steadily increasing fast-food prices over the past two years, prompting chains such as McDonald's and Burger King to dole out more offers to attract customers. Cava, in contrast, took a 3% menu price increase in January with no further price increases planned in 2024, Wedbush analyst Nick Setyan noted. ""While many have commented on decelerating traffic in the market, we have seen sustained momentum,"" CEO Brett Schulman said on post-earnings call. Consumers are trading up from cheaper fast food options as price increases since the pandemic have made Cava more competitive with quick service restaurants, Jefferies analyst Andy Barish said. ""We continue to view... CAVA's attractive value proposition, growth in advertising, increased brand awareness, menu innovation (like steak) ... as drivers of growth in the near- to medium-term,"" Wedbush's Setyan said. Cava's restaurant-level margin improved by 40 basis points to 26.5% in the quarter, as higher sales and favorable commodity costs offset increased wages and the introduction of higher-cost steak. The stock was on pace to log its best session ever, if gains hold. Full-year same restaurant sales growth is now expected at 8.5% to 9.5% from prior forecast range of 4.5% to 6.5%. It expects core earnings to come in between $109 million to $114 million. Cava's forward price-to-earnings ratio for the next 12 months, a common benchmark for valuing stocks, was 244.78, compared with Chipotle Mexican Grill's 43.57.

After the market close on Thursday, the Mediterranean fast-casual chain reported second quarter results that beat estimates across revenue, earnings, and same-store sales. Net sales jumped 35.2% year over year to $233.5 million, compared with expectations of $219 million. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $0.17, versus the $0.13 expected. Same-store sales jumped 14.4%, more than the 7.45% Wall Street expected. Sales growth was driven by higher foot traffic (up 9.5% year over year), an increase in menu price, new locations, and the launch of grilled steak on June 3. On Wednesday, Cava stock hit a record-high close of $102.39, and on Friday, it hit an intraday high of $122.95, making its biggest intraday jump ever. The steak launch surpassed its expectations by a landslide, CEO Brett Schulman told Yahoo Finance the team is ""working on a deep pipeline of innovation"" for the next few years. Schulman said the company's ""value proposition"" is drawing diners as consumers trade down from fine-dining restaurants but trade up from fast food. The company raised its full year outlook to sales growth of 8.5% to 9.5% as a ""reflection of the strength we continue to see in the business,"" he told Yahoo Finance, adding that he expects to hold onto momentum in Q3 and Q4. ""It implies low double digit comps [comparable same-store sales growth] for the remainder of the year,"" he said. Shares are up 180% year to date, compared to 20% for Chipotle (CMG) and 18% for the S&P 500 (^GSPC). Slow and steady is Cava's go-to approach to expansion. By 2032, the company plans to have 1,000 Cava locations. Citi analyst Jon Tower said there's still room left for growth in a note to clients. ""A unit growth opportunity that continues to re-set higher, discrete same-store sales, price, and margin opportunities as the system densifies and margin tailwinds as the footprint shifts towards lower cost markets."" In Q2, Cava opened 18 new locations, bringing the total to 341. TD Cowen analyst Andrew Charles is bullish on Cava's 2032 goal, citing its wide appeal. He expects 50% of next year's new locations to have digital pick up lanes. There are currently 45 as of now. Stifel analyst Chris O’Cull, who has a buy rating on Cava, projects long-term revenue growth in the 17-20% range, boosted by 15% unit growth and low to mid-single digit same store sales growth. Schulman said within existing markets, there is still runway to build more brand awareness. Other future growth drivers include the relaunch of its loyalty program in October and catering.                      ",

As of 9:51 a.m. ET, Cava stock was up 14.1% on the news. Cava said that comparable sales surged 14.4% in the period, driven by 9.5% traffic growth. That drove revenue up 35.2% to $231.4 million, which was ahead of estimates of $219.5 million. Cava continues to expand its footprint as well: It added 18 restaurants to bring its grand total to 341, up 22% from a year ago. The company also showed off strong margin improvement as its restaurant-level profit margin improved to 26.5% from 26.1% in the quarter a year ago. Margins benefited from leverage from higher sales. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) nearly tripled, from $12.7 million to $34.3 million, and generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) net income tripled to $19.7 million, or $0.17 a share, which beat the consensus of $0.12. CEO Brett Schulman said, ""Our results in the second quarter continued to demonstrate the strength of our category-defining brand and our unique and compelling value proposition."" He also talked up the addition of grilled steak to the menu, saying, ""Grilled steak is significantly outperforming our expectations and giving guests another reason to visit Cava and come back more often."" Cava also hiked its full-year guidance substantially. It now sees comparable sales growth of 8.5%-9.5%, up from a prior range of 4.5%-6.5%, as well as an increase in restaurant-level profit margin and adjusted EBITDA. The numbers show that Cava is executing at a high level with average unit volumes and restaurant-level profit margins that rival Chipotle's.

Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times. Cava , which belongs to the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry, posted revenues of $233.5 million for the quarter ended June 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5.17%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $172.89 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.

Cava shares have added about 139.3% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 17.8%. While Cava has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock? There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately. Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions. Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Cava: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

(NYSE: CAVA) (""CAVA Group"" or the ""Company""), the category-defining Mediterranean fast-casual restaurant brand that brings heart, health, and humanity to food, today announced financial results for its fiscal second quarter ended July 14, 2024. ""Our results in the second quarter continued to demonstrate the strength of our category-defining brand and our unique and compelling value proposition,"" said Brett Schulman, Co-Founder and CEO. ""During the quarter, traffic grew 9.5%, we opened 18 net new restaurants and, driven by the power of our unit economic engine, generated average unit volume of $2.7 million. In addition, we launched our new grilled steak main, once again exhibiting our excellence in culinary innovation. Grilled steak is significantly outperforming our expectations and giving guests another reason to visit CAVA and come back more often."" Fiscal Second Quarter 2024 Highlights: CAVA Revenue grew 35.2% to $231.4 million as compared to $171.1 million in the prior year quarter. Net New CAVA Restaurant Openings of 18, bringing total CAVA Restaurants to 341, a 22.2% increase in total CAVA Restaurants year over year. CAVA Same Restaurant Sales Growth of 14.4%, including traffic growth of 9.5%. CAVA AUV of $2.7 million as compared to $2.6 million in the prior year quarter.

CAVA Group Adjusted EBITDA(1) of $34.3 million compared to $21.6 million in the prior year quarter. Net cash provided by operating activities of $48.9 million with Free Cash Flow(1) of $22.7 million. CAVA Fiscal Second Quarter 2024 Review: CAVA Revenue was $231.4 million, an increase of 35.2% compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2023. The increase was primarily driven by 78 Net New CAVA Restaurant Openings during or subsequent to the second quarter of fiscal 2023, which are exceeding our performance expectations, and CAVA Same Restaurant Sales Growth of 14.4%. CAVA Same Restaurant Sales Growth consists of a 9.5% increase from guest traffic and a 4.9% increase from menu price and product mix. CAVA Restaurant-Level Profit Margin was 26.5% compared with 26.1% in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. The increase was due to leverage from higher sales, partially offset by incremental wage investments and input costs associated with the June 3rd launch of grilled steak. CAVA Group Fiscal Second Quarter 2024 Review: General and administrative expenses were $28.3 million, or 12.1% of revenue, as compared to $23.3 million, or 13.5% of revenue, in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. General and administrative expenses, excluding equity-based compensation and certain non-recurring public company costs in the prior year quarter(1), were $24.7 million, or 10.6% of revenue, as compared to $20.4 million, or 11.8% of revenue, in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. The decrease of 120 basis points was primarily due to leverage from higher sales, partially offset by investments to support future growth and increased recurring public company costs. Net income was $19.7 million, or 8.5% of revenue, an increase of $13.2 million as compared to $6.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Adjusted EBITDA(1) was $34.3 million, or 14.7% of revenue, an increase of $12.7 million, or 59.0%, compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2023. The increase was primarily driven by the number and strength of performance of Net New CAVA Restaurant Openings during or subsequent to the second quarter of fiscal 2023, 14.4% CAVA Same Restaurant Sales Growth, and leverage in general and administrative expenses. __________________ (1) General and administrative expenses, excluding equity-based compensation and certain non-recurring public company costs, Adjusted EBITDA, and Free Cash Flow are non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP are set forth in the tables at the end of this press release. Fiscal Full-Year 2024 Outlook: CAVA Group announced today that it has raised fiscal full-year 2024 guidance, as follows:   May 28, 2024  August 22, 2024 Net New CAVA Restaurant Openings  50 to 54  54 to 57 CAVA Same Restaurant Sales Growth  4.5% to 6.5%  8.5% to 9.5% CAVA Restaurant-Level Profit Margin  23.7% to 24.3%  24.2% to 24.7% Pre-opening costs  $12.0 to $13.0 million  $12.0 to $13.0 million Adjusted EBITDA  $100.0 to $105.0 million  $109.0 to $114.0 million Actual results may differ materially from CAVA Group's fiscal full-year 2024 guidance as a result of, among other things, the factors described under ""Forward-Looking Statements"" below. A reconciliation of the forward-looking fiscal 2024 Adjusted EBITDA to net income cannot be provided without unreasonable effort because of the inherent difficulty of accurately forecasting the occurrence and financial impact of the various adjusting items necessary for such reconciliation that have not yet occurred, are out of our control, or cannot be reasonably predicted.

The forward-looking statements contained in this press release are based on management’s current expectations and are not guarantees of future performance. The forward-looking statements are subject to various risks, uncertainties, assumptions, or changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict or quantify. Our expectations, beliefs, and projections are expressed in good faith, and we believe there is a reasonable basis for them. However, there can be no assurance that management’s expectations, beliefs, and projections will result or be achieved. Actual results may differ materially from these expectations due to changes in global, regional, or local economic, business, competitive, market, regulatory, and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. We believe that these factors include but are not limited to the following: our operation in a highly competitive industry; our ability to open new restaurants while managing our growth effectively and maintaining our culture; our ability to successfully identify appropriate locations and develop and expand our operations in existing and new markets; the profitability of new restaurants, and any impact to sales at our existing locations; the impact of changes in guest perception of our brand; our ability to successfully market our restaurants and brand; the impact of food safety, health department regulations, and food-borne illness concerns together with our ability to adequately address such concerns and meet regulatory obligations, including at our manufacturing facilities; our ability to maintain or increase prices; our ability to accurately predict guest trends and demand and successfully introduce new menu offerings and improve our existing menu offerings; the risks associated with leasing property; our ability to successfully expand our digital and delivery business; our ability to utilize, recognize, respond to, and effectively manage the immediacy of social media; our ability to achieve or maintain profitability in the future, especially if we continue to grow at an accelerated rate; our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from past and potential future acquisitions, investments or other strategic initiatives; our ability to manage our manufacturing and supply chain effectively; the impact of shortages, delays, or interruptions in the delivery of food items and other products; our ability to successfully optimize, operate, and manage our production facilities; the risks associated with our reliance on third parties; the impact of increases in food, commodity, energy, and other costs; the impact of increases in labor costs, labor shortages, and our ability to identify, hire, train, motivate and retain the right team members; our ability to attract, develop, and retain our management team and key team members; the impact of any cybersecurity breaches and our ability to respond effectively to technology threats or events; the impact of failures, or interruptions in, or our inability to effectively scale and adapt, our information technology systems; our ability to comply with, or changes in, the extensive laws or regulations requirements to which we are subject, including those related to privacy; the impact of economic factors and guest behavior trends; the impact of evolving rules and regulations with respect to environmental, social and governance matters; risks associated with our ability to secure, and protect our intellectual property; risks associated with civil unrest, acts of terrorism, threats to national security, the conflicts in Eastern Europe and the Middle East and other geopolitical events, including potential discriminatory perspectives towards certain cuisines; the impact of climate change and volatile adverse weather conditions; and each of the other factors set forth in ""Part I—Item 1A. Risk Factors"" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, and in other reports filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, all of which are available on the investor relations page of our website at investor.cava.com The forward-looking statements included in this press release are made only as of the date hereof. Any forward-looking statement made by us in this press release speaks only as of the date of this press release and are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements included in this press release. Factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. Non-GAAP Financial Measures: In addition to our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with GAAP, we present Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, general and administrative expenses, excluding equity-based compensation and certain non-recurring public company costs, and Free Cash Flow in this press release as supplemental measures of financial performance that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe they assist investors and analysts in comparing our operating performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our operating performance. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, general and administrative expenses, excluding equity-based compensation and certain non-recurring public company costs, and Free Cash Flow are useful to investors in highlighting trends in our operating performance, while other measures can differ significantly depending on long-term strategic decisions regarding capital structure, the tax jurisdictions in which we operate, and capital investments. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, general and administrative expenses, excluding equity-based compensation and certain non-recurring public company costs, and Free Cash Flow to supplement GAAP measures of performance in the evaluation of the effectiveness of our business strategies, to make budgeting decisions, and to compare our performance against that of other peer companies using similar measures. Management supplements GAAP results with non-GAAP financial measures to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the business than GAAP results alone provide. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, general and administrative expenses, excluding equity-based compensation and certain non-recurring public company costs, and Free Cash Flow are not recognized terms under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to net income, net income margin, or general and administrative expenses, as applicable, as measures of financial performance or cash provided by operating activities as measures of liquidity, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow are not intended to be measures of free cash flow available for management’s discretionary use, as Adjusted EBITDA does not consider certain cash requirements such as tax payments and financing cash flows, and Free Cash Flow does not consider certain cash requirements such as financing cash flows. Our non-GAAP measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation, or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow do not reflect cash flows from financing activities of our business; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect period to period changes in taxes, income tax expense, or the cash necessary to pay income taxes; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the impact of earnings or cash charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations; although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, general and administrative expenses, excluding equity-based compensation and certain non-recurring public company costs, and Free Cash Flow differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.

Cava Group (CAVA), which belongs to the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry, could be a great candidate to consider. When looking at the last two reports, this Mediterranean restaurant chain has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 150%, on average, in the last two quarters. For the most recent quarter, Cava was expected to post earnings of $0.04 per share, but it reported $0.12 per share instead, representing a surprise of 200%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $0.01 per share, while it actually produced $0.02 per share, a surprise of 100%. For Cava, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank. Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven. The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier. Cava currently has an Earnings ESP of +11.37%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on August 22, 2024. When the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss. Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.     ",

CAVA is slated to release second-quarter 2024 financial numbers on Aug 22, after the closing bell.

In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 200%. CAVA surpassed earnings in all of the trailing four quarters, the surprise being 450%, on average. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings per share (EPS) has remained flat at 12 cents. The estimated figure indicates a 42.9% decline from the year-ago EPS of 21 cents. However, the consensus mark for revenues is pegged at $220.6 million, indicating 27.6% year-over-year growth. Our proven model doesn't conclusively predict an earnings beat for CAVA Group this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.

Zacks Rank: The company carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at present. CAVA Group, Inc. price-eps-surprise | CAVA Group, Inc. Quote The company’s performance is likely to be aided by strategic initiatives such as the nationwide introduction of premium-priced steak and a revamped loyalty program. Menu price increases, robust digitalization, a favorable product mix and new restaurant openings continue to drive growth. Its performance is also likely to have been aided by robust visitation. CAVA is committed to maintaining high standards of restaurant operations, ensuring excellence at every location and during every shift, which is aiding the company.

The company's emphasis on category-defining brands and highly-differentiated product offerings bolstered growth prospects to some extent. A sequential improvement in visitation is likely to have driven the top line. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CAVA Group’s restaurant sales is pegged at $218.4 million, suggesting an increase of 25.7% year over year. The consensus mark for CAVA’s same restaurant sales is pegged at growth of 7.2% year over year.

However, increases in food, beverage and packaging expenses, along with labor inflation due to higher average hourly wages, are likely to have negatively impacted the bottom line. Commodity inflation is also likely to have been an overhang. This year, CAVA stock has outperformed the industry and the S&P 500. Year to date, the stock has skyrocketed 133.1% against the industry’s decline of 2.4%. However, other major players have also seen declines — Darden Restaurants, Inc. DRI is down 8.9%, McDonald's Corporation MCD is down 3% and Restaurant Brands International Inc. QSR is down 8.4%.           ",

Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important? Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Cava Group (CAVA) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage. Cava currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.89, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 14 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.89 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy. Of the 14 recommendations that derive the current ABR, seven are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 50% and 7.1% of all recommendations. Check price target & stock forecast for Cava here>>>

The ABR suggests buying Cava, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation. Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation. In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement. Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision. Although both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether. Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.            ",

This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price. The earnings report, which is expected to be released on August 22, 2024, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower. While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise. This Mediterranean restaurant chain is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.12 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -42.9%. Revenues are expected to be $220.63 million, up 27.6% from the year-ago quarter. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.59% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period. Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts. Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction). The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier. Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only. A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.

Meanwhile, the Dow experienced a drop of 0.36%, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq saw an increase of 0.21%. Shares of the Mediterranean restaurant chain witnessed a gain of 7.17% over the previous month, beating the performance of the Retail-Wholesale sector with its loss of 6.2% and the S&P 500's loss of 4.22%. The investment community will be paying close attention to the earnings performance of Cava Group in its upcoming release. The company is slated to reveal its earnings on August 22, 2024. On that day, Cava Group is projected to report earnings of $0.12 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 42.86%. At the same time, our most recent consensus estimate is projecting a revenue of $220.63 million, reflecting a 27.61% rise from the equivalent quarter last year. For the annual period, the Zacks Consensus Estimates anticipate earnings of $0.34 per share and a revenue of $905.54 million, signifying shifts of +61.9% and +24.27%, respectively, from the last year. Furthermore, it would be beneficial for investors to monitor any recent shifts in analyst projections for Cava Group. Such recent modifications usually signify the changing landscape of near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook. Empirical research indicates that these revisions in estimates have a direct correlation with impending stock price performance. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system. The Zacks Rank system, stretching from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has a noteworthy track record of outperforming, validated by third-party audits, with stocks rated #1 producing an average annual return of +25% since the year 1988. Over the past month, there's been a 0.42% rise in the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. As of now, Cava Group holds a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). From a valuation perspective, Cava Group is currently exchanging hands at a Forward P/E ratio of 262.25. This represents a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 19.72.

Its 40,000 stores collectively did $119.8 billion worth of business last year, generating $25.5 billion of revenue and $8.5 billion of net income for the company. No other name even comes close to matching those numbers. From an investor's standpoint, however, size isn't everything. Indeed, size can even be a drawback by virtue of making it tougher to tack on more growth. In some cases, a new McDonald's location's top competitor could be another nearby McDonald's restaurant that's already up and running. If you're looking for a more promising bet from the quick-service restaurant space, consider Cava Group (NYSE: CAVA) instead. With only 323 restaurants as of the first quarter, Cava isn't exactly the household name that McDonald's is. In places where Cava's been operating for some time, though, consumers are in love with its Mediterranean fare. Its pita wraps and bowls are ideal for the fast-casual model while feeding the demand from evolving consumer preferences. While the hamburger has dominated the quick-service restaurant landscape for decades, their health drawbacks are finally catching up with them. The enriched bread used to make most hamburger buns and heavily processed red meats are falling out of favor. Consumers are increasingly willing to pay even a small premium for fresh, natural ingredients like the ones Cava uses. The real draw here, however, is the cuisine itself. It's relatively undiscovered by most U.S. consumers who are finding that, once they try it, they like it. Its health benefits are just an added marketability bonus. In other words, this is the ""something else"" consumers appear to have been waiting for from the fast-casual restaurant industry. And Cava's numbers back the claim up. Take its first-quarter results as an example. During the three-month stretch ended April 21, Cava grew its top line 30.3% year over year to $256.3 million, while same-store sales improved 2.3% against a very tough comparison of 28.3% in the year-ago period. Better still, despite its young age and small size, Cava Group is increasingly profitable. The first quarter's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) of $33.3 million doubled year over year, and net income of $14.0 million completely reversed the year-ago loss of $2.1 million. Cava logged this profitability while opening 14 new restaurants during the quarter.             ",

Older generations grew up with iconic brands like McDonald's. However, younger consumers seem to have different tastes than their parents and grandparents; according to a 2022 survey by Food Insight, nearly 8 in 10 Gen Z eaters have healthier dietary habits, including an emphasis on clean and plant-based foods. Cava Group (NYSE: CAVA) and Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG) are two fast-growing quick-service restaurant brands with generous runways for long-term growth. Both stocks have earned premium valuations with solid fundamentals and expansive growth opportunities. Here is why investors should consider dollar-cost averaging into each and holding them for years. The Mediterranean diet -- heavy on plants, healthy fats, whole grains, and lean proteins while light on red meat -- is becoming one of the most popular diet trends in the United States. According to Stagwell, it has an 85% popularity rating among Americans and was named the most popular health plan for the seventh consecutive year in 2024. Studies have shown that a Mediterranean diet has numerous health benefits, including weight loss, improved cardiovascular health, and lower inflammation. There is no quick-service Mediterranean restaurant chain with household-level brand recognition in the U.S., but that could soon change. Cava Group is among a handful of brands racing to win mindshare among healthy eaters in America. The company was founded in 2006 but only went public last year. If you've ever been to a Chipotle, it's the same idea: fresh food prepared daily, with customizable meals made to order. The investment potential with Cava is that it has a lot of room to expand. There are 323 restaurants, primarily located along the eastern and southeastern seaboards. That leaves most of the U.S. to grow into. Cava has increased its store footprint by 22% year over year as of Q1, including 13 new stores in the quarter. Expansion drove roughly 30% year-over-year revenue growth. Cava already has positive free cash flow and is GAAP profitable. It's a simple business that should grow steadily as it opens new stores. Eventually, its profits might grow large enough for the company to begin repurchasing shares to continue driving earnings per share even higher. How much opportunity is ahead? There could eventually be thousands of Cava stores. (Taco Bell, for example, has nearly 8,000 stores in the U.S. alone.)                     ",

A quarter ago, it was expected that this operator of Burger King and Tim Hortons restaurant chains would post earnings of $0.72 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.73, delivering a surprise of 1.39%. Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times. Restaurant Brands , which belongs to the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry, posted revenues of $2.08 billion for the quarter ended June 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.70%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.78 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.

Sure, economists and pundits may argue that this latest jobs report is not necessarily a sign of a looming U.S. recession. Still, you may want to err on the side of caution, especially with consumer discretionary stocks that trade at rich valuation. In a nutshell, consumer discretionary stocks are shares in companies that sell non-essential goods and services. These types of companies can perform very well during economic boom times. In a recessionary environment, however, they can experience big drops in demand. In turn, leading to corresponding big swings in operating performance. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips As slight changes in the macro backdrop could dramatically affect their performance, overvalued names in the consumer discretionary sector are most at risk of experiencing sharp price declines. So, ahead of further indication that economic challenges are growing, what are the top consumer discretionary stocks to sell? Consider these seven. Each one is “priced for perfection,” and could take a big tumble if macro factors are no longer in their favor. Source: William Potter / Shutterstock.com Beyond (NASDAQ:BYON) is an e-commerce company that you may know better as Overstock.com. Last year, Overstock.com bought bankrupt Bed Bath & Beyond’s brand name, re-launching its own flagship platform using the brand, and taking on the retailer’s more well-known name as part of its corporate name. Investors at first reacted positively to these sweeping changes. During late 2023 and early 2024, BYON stock more than doubled in price. However, during the late spring to early summer, reported wider-than-expected losses weighted on Beyond’s stock price performance. Although subsequent quarterly results have been much more well-received, the above-mentioned macro data suggests that further trouble may lie ahead for the retailer and its turnaround plans. Trading for just $10 per share, and with a market cap of around $475 million, BYON may appear as though it is discounted for uncertainty. However, net losses are expected to come in at $3.76 per share this year. If an economic slowdown stymies Beyond’s ability to narrow these losses in 2025, BYON may be on its way back to single-digit prices. Or worse, down to penny stock territory, or under $5 per share.

As I have discussed in prior coverage of this high-flying dining stock, investors have considered Cava a buy at any price, due to perceptions that its the next big restaurant growth story.

Buy Cava Instead,"Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG) has been a massive success as a business and as an investment. Shares of the fast-casual restaurant chain have gained over 5,000% since the stock's initial public offering! Newcomer Cava Group (NYSE: CAVA), which serves up Mediterranean fare, has only been public since mid-2023 and its stock price has advanced around 80% or so, but that's still nowhere near as much as Chipotle's has gained over time. There's an opportunity here with the name on the block, but go in understanding the risks. Let's dive in. When you look at one of Chipotle's 3,500 restaurant locations, you'll see what was once a fairly unique concept. There is an assembly line where an employee helps customers build a meal from freshly made ingredients. Many of those ingredients, meanwhile, are being prepared right behind the assembly line in a visible kitchen, so customers can actually see the food that's being used. Not only does this approach allow for highly customized meals, but it increases the feeling that the food is high quality. This is pretty much what you'll find at one of Cava's 320 or so locations, as well. The big difference is the type of food being created. Chipotle Mexican Grill, as its name implies, uses a Mexican theme. Cava's theme is Mediterranean. Both have been very popular with customers. Chipotle's growth over time is all the proof you need of its success with eaters, while Cava's same-store sales growth in 2023 was a huge 17.9%. That said, nearly 18% same-store sales growth is not a sustainable figure. The first quarter saw same-store sales growth drop to 2.3%, but that's not a bad figure. In fact, if Cava can sustain that level of same-store sales growth while it continues to expand its footprint, there remains a huge opportunity. Indeed, new store openings over the past year helped to push overall sales at Cava up 30% year over year in the first quarter. But the comparison to Chipotle is what's really interesting here. Remember, Chipotle has 3,500 locations versus just 320 or so for Cava. That means Cava could, realistically, grow its business by 10 times and not fully saturate the market. Chipotle is still expanding, too, so there's clearly more room ahead even for this very large business. And all Cava needs to do to rapidly increase its top line is to keep its core business running well, which is what same-store sales tell you, while opening new locations. It opened 14 in the first quarter. So if you feel like you've missed out on Chipotle, Cava is probably a good stock for you to be looking at now. But you need to go in with your eyes open. First off, execution will be vital to Cava's success. This is why investors need to keep an eye on both the top line and same-store sales. Fast-growing young restaurant concepts often get pushed by Wall Street to grow as quickly as possible and, eventually, that can lead to management getting distracted. If same-store sales were to weaken materially, investors will want to tread with great caution. Second, the Chipotle comparison isn't lost on Wall Street when it comes to Cava. Indeed, Cava's price-to-earnings ratio is a huge 380. To be fair, Chipotle's P/E is pretty high at around 55 times, but clearly investors are pricing in a lot of good news into Cava's stock. With expectations that high, a shortfall of any kind, even a modest one, could lead to a quick stock price decline. If you buy Cava you'll probably need some fortitude to stick around. Investors are buying Cava because they think it has a huge growth opportunity ahead of it. If you compare it to Chipotle, given the similarity of the concepts, that looks like a reasonable expectation. The key from here is going to be Cava's ability to deliver from a nuts-and-bolts perspective, which is not going to be easy. But if you can stomach the lofty valuation and are willing to keep close tabs on the interplay between sales and same-store sales, Cava seems like a good choice for growth investors that feel like they've missed out on Chipotle.

Most consumers have probably never even heard of it, let alone eaten at one of its 323 restaurants spread across 25 states. Indeed, the most likely reason you're reading this right now is simply because the company's been getting lots of added attention since going public in June 2023, sending the stock much higher in the meantime. If you're looking for a new growth investment, Cava stock remains a compelling option despite the added hype this past year. Four reasons stand out for this assessment. For the unfamiliar, Cava is a restaurant chain featuring fast-casual Mediterranean cuisine. It operates in the space between fast food and traditional ""sit-down"" service, offering a scaled-down menu that features fresh ingredients combined into easy-to-make/easy-to-eat meals at a price that won't break the bank. The company opened its first store in 2010 and has grown relatively quickly to 323 locales as of April. Apparently, consumers love this fast-casual alternative to burgers and burritos. There are four very specific reasons investors might want to nibble on Cava stock sooner rather than later. The growth in the number of restaurants Cava continues opening is telling. But this isn't just expansion for the sake of enlarging a physical footprint. More restaurants means more revenue at the same time each locale is growing its base of paying customers. The company's fiscal Q1 revenue improved 30.3% year over year, largely thanks to the 14 stores opened during the quarter in question. But it was also boosted by modest same-store sales growth. This progress extends a well-established growth streak that extends back for several years. While growth is expected of all young companies, Cava is still unique compared to similarly sized peers and other, similarly aged start-ups. It's profitable right now. It's not wildly profitable, mind you. Of the first quarter's revenue of $259 million, only $14 million (or 5.4%) of it was turned into net income. That's not a lot. It's a lot for a young company in this particular industry, however, and encouraging if only because its ever-widening profit margins confirm this enterprise can be self-sustaining. Profits aren't the only distinguishing factor here, however. Cava is also different from almost any other player of its ilk by virtue of remaining debt-free. As of April, the company only owed $122,000 in long-term obligations versus $329,000 in cash or cash equivalents. It's also only got $111,000 in near-term debt. Don't misread the message: Cava is raising money in ways that technically disadvantage shareholders. Namely, it's issuing stock to come up with cash. There are now nearly 118 million outstanding shares of Cava stock, well up from the less than 17 million sold via its initial public offering in June of last year. Look for more stock issuance in the foreseeable future as well, as the company funds its growth efforts. On balance, however, this is arguably the better option for current shareholders with stakes that are being diluted. The pros outweigh the cons, if only by virtue of keeping Cava fiscally flexible. Last but not least, interested investors might want to go ahead and buy Cava stock like there's no tomorrow, just because shares are trading down 13% from their recent all-time high. No, that's not a lot. That may be all the discount you're going to see anytime soon from this ticker, however. That's roughly the same size as April's pullback, which ultimately gave way to the rally carrying shares to their recently reached record. Don't get short-sighted: While the bullish case for Cava Group is sound, there's also no denying this is still a young company that will be tested. It may even fail some of these tests; it just comes with the territory. That's going to keep this stock's volatility ramped up to levels that might prove uncomfortable. For investors that can stomach the risk and volatility, though, this restaurant name could easily be at home in the growth portion of your portfolio. The whole Mediterranean concept is clearly clicking with consumers in a way that isn't often seen within the restaurant business.

Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. So on that note, CAVA Group (NYSE:CAVA) looks quite promising in regards to its trends of return on capital. Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for CAVA Group: Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities) 0.027 = US$24m ÷ (US$1.0b - US$111m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to April 2024). Therefore, CAVA Group has an ROCE of 2.7%. In absolute terms, that's a low return and it also under-performs the Hospitality industry average of 11%. Check out our latest analysis for CAVA Group In the above chart we have measured CAVA Group's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free analyst report for CAVA Group . The fact that CAVA Group is now generating some pre-tax profits from its prior investments is very encouraging. Shareholders would no doubt be pleased with this because the business was loss-making two years ago but is is now generating 2.7% on its capital. In addition to that, CAVA Group is employing 126% more capital than previously which is expected of a company that's trying to break into profitability. This can tell us that the company has plenty of reinvestment opportunities that are able to generate higher returns. Overall, CAVA Group gets a big tick from us thanks in most part to the fact that it is now profitable and is reinvesting in its business. Since the stock has returned a solid 59% to shareholders over the last year, it's fair to say investors are beginning to recognize these changes. So given the stock has proven it has promising trends, it's worth researching the company further to see if these trends are likely to persist. One more thing: We've identified 2 warning signs with CAVA Group (at least 1 which is concerning) , and understanding these would certainly be useful.   ",

Shares of Cava have soared 66% in the past 12 months (as of July 18), crushing the 25% total return of the S&P 500. Growth-minded investors are probably eyeing Cava right now, even though it has cooled down and dropped 17% off its peak. But is it too late to buy this restaurant stock? In the grand scheme of the restaurant sector, Cava is still tiny. As of April 21, it had 323 stores across the U.S. However, the business added 72 net new locations in fiscal 2023, and management plans to open 52 this year. The growth potential is certainly exciting. Cava is hitting on some key trends that are working in its favor. For starters, the fast-casual food setup is a hit with consumers, thanks to its relative affordability and greater convenience when compared to fine dining. Moreover, Cava's focus on healthy menu items is likely drawing more interest thanks to heightened focus from customers on their wellness. The company's most bullish supporters won't hesitate to compare Cava to Chipotle. According to the leadership team, the overarching objective is to have 1,000 stores open by 2032, translating to a roughly three-fold expansion from the current footprint. Based on the stock's performance, investors might assume that this target is a foregone conclusion. I'm a bit more skeptical about Cava's long-term potential. That's because the restaurant sector is incredibly competitive. There are no barriers to entry, and customers have zero switching costs. So, Cava's ultimate success is far from certain. A lot of things need to go right on the path to 1,000 stores, but a lot of things can also go wrong. In the latest quarter (first-quarter 2024 ended April 21), Cava reported year-over-year revenue growth of 30.3%. That's very impressive. But it's worth pointing out that the vast majority of this gain came from new restaurant locations. Same-store sales, which is a key performance metric for retail-based enterprises, were up only 2.3% during the quarter. Chipotle, on the other hand, posted a 7% increase in the first three months of 2024. Some could argue that Cava is simply dealing with the uncertain macro environment, with inflationary pressures pinching consumer spending. However, if Cava ever wants to come close to Chipotle's level of success, it needs to produce better results. The business can't rely on new store openings forever. In fact, investors shouldn't want this, either.             ",

You might even have a favorite dish, but which of these hot stocks is the better buy? Cava and Sweetgreen operate similar models. Both are small but growing restaurant chains with the fast-casual model and offer healthy, eco-conscious dishes with fresh ingredients at prices that fall between fast food and fine dining. Cava's spin on the model is a Mediterranean take, while Sweetgreen has a focus on salads. Both of these are relatively new initial public offerings (IPO), so there's not a lot to go by in terms of track records. Inflation is cutting into some of these numbers, which only give investors a bite-size look at the overall picture. That's why IPO stocks can be risky, and these numbers would probably look a lot different under better conditions. Company Q1 Sales Growth YoY Q1 Comps Growth YoY Q1 Restaurant Count Q1 New Restaurants Full-year New Restaurants Full-year Comps Guidance Cava 30.3% 2.3% 323 14 52 5.5% Sweetgreen 26% 5% 225 6 25 5% Data source: Cava and Sweetgreen quarterly reports. Q1 = 2024 first quarter. Comps = comparable sales. YoY = year over year. Let's take a look at some of their recent growth metrics. You'll see that Cava has more restaurants and opened more restaurants in the first quarter. That's why its revenue is growing faster even though comps growth was slow. Being young and growing, both Cava and Sweetgreen are still struggling to turn dollars into profits. But while Cava has had some success in reporting positive net income, Sweetgreen hasn't yet hit that milestone. Let's do another comparison. Company Q1 net Income Net Income Growth YoY Q1 Restaurant Profit Margin Restaurant Profit Margin Guidance Cava $14 million 800% 25.2% 24% Sweetgreen ($26.1) million 23% 18% 19% Data source: Cava and Sweetgreen quarterly reports. Q1 = 2024 first quarter. YoY = year over year. Even worse for Sweetgreen, it missed Wall Street's expectations for earnings per share (EPS) for the past four quarters, while Cava reported a beat all four times. Sweetgreen is making progress, but Cava is in a far better position right now. There's another factor to consider when deciding which of these companies is a better business, and that's valuation. Cava sports a price-to-sales ratio that's much higher than Sweetgreen's. While Cava stock seems like it may be overvalued at this price, it reflects investor sentiment about its stock. Both of these stocks have been benefiting from investor enthusiasm, with Cava up 90% year to date and Sweetgreen up 123%.           ",

Wall Street Has Its Doubts,"Cava Group (NYSE: CAVA) has been a hot stock since its initial public offering (IPO) last year. It burst onto the scene with a fresh restaurant concept that's been catching on across the country, and investors are hoping it becomes the next big restaurant chain. While investors can't seem to get enough of Cava stock, Wall Street has taken a more cautious view of the company. Is it still a buy? Cava is one of several hot stocks in the fast-casual restaurant category. Pioneered by Chipotle Mexican Grill, fast-casual chains offer a step-up in ambiance and quality from fast-food. Other popular names include Sweetgreen and Shake Shack. As an up-and-coming player in the space, Cava sets itself apart with a Mediterranean-focused menu, and it's growing quickly. The company isn't only reporting strong revenue growth but rising profitability as well. In its fiscal 2024 first quarter, 14 new restaurant openings helped push the company's top line 30% higher to $256.3 million. It also reversed its prior-year loss of $1.30 per share with $0.12 per share in earnings during the quarter. The chain is already operating in 25 states plus Washington D.C. with 323 total stores, and management plans to keep expanding throughout the country. They say the concept is easily transferable to all markets, and investors are excited about Cava's growth runway. It only has about a tenth of Chipotle's restaurant count at this point. Cava stock has pulled back in July, partially due to analysts reporting lower restaurant spending in the second quarter. With shares trading at $81.48 as of this writing, the median analyst target price for the next 12 to 18 months is only 10% higher at $90. And only half of the 16 analysts covering the stock recommend it as a buy. Part of that could be due to its high valuation. It trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 181 and a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 11, a significant premium over other, faster-growing stocks. But it's more than that. Cava is competing against much larger brands in the restaurant space, and its staying power is largely unknown. The company has only been profitable for a few quarters, and its same-store sales increased only 2.3% year over year last quarter. Even worse, those gains came entirely from increased prices as traffic fell 1.2%. So, how important is it to pay attention to what Wall Street analysts are saying? Investors should use treat their analysis as yet another data point. The better informed you are before you buy a stock, the more likely you are to make a good decision. If you're bullish but see Wall Street taking a different stance, it's worth exploring their reasons for concern.            ",

Cava Group (NYSE: CAVA) has also built its foundation on the same concept, but with the distinction that Chipotle focuses on Mexican food while Cava specializes in Mediterranean fare. The latter, of course, is a much smaller chain, which makes the comparison with Chipotle extra interesting. Which is a better investment right now? Every restaurant chain starts from modest beginnings, but not every restaurant chain can grow to have 3,500 locations like Chipotle. Sure, McDonald's (NYSE: MCD) and Yum! Brands' (NYSE: YUM) Taco Bell are both much larger, but they've also been around for a lot longer than Chipotle. Chipotle, in fact, has only been a public company since 2006, when it held its initial public offering. By just about any measure, Chipotle is a standout in the restaurant sector today. And the chain continues to execute at a high level, with first-quarter sales rising a huge 14.1% and same-store sales, which looks at sales for locations open for at least a year, up a very impressive 7%. That speaks to a management team that is firing on all cylinders, operating its current fleet at a high level, which is captured in the same-store number, while also adding new locations that boost overall sales. There's a reason why Chipotle's price-to-earnings ratio is nearly 60. While that's below the five-year average of around 70, it is still quite high on an absolute basis. Investors are paying up for a fairly large company that they expect to keep growing strongly. That's entirely possible, but growth becomes more and more difficult to achieve the larger you get. It's a numbers game. Adding one restaurant when you own only one restaurant is a 100% increase in the store base. But the third location is only a 50% increase. The more restaurants you add, the slower the expansion rate becomes. Still, for more conservative investors looking to invest in growth stocks, Chipotle's proven success will be very compelling. Just go in knowing you are paying a big premium, noting that McDonald's P/E is only 22 and its five-year average P/E is 27. By comparison, Cava is a tiny little restaurant chain with just 320 or so locations. But it opened 14 new sites in the first quarter of 2024. All told, the store base grew a huge 22% year over year! That's a number that would be almost unthinkable for Chipotle, which speaks to the opportunity ahead for Cava. Cava is coming off of a very strong run. In 2023 its sales increased nearly 60% and its same-store sales rose by almost 18%. Those just aren't sustainable figures and they will probably make 2024 results look a bit less exciting because the company will be comparing against truly astounding growth figures. For example, first-quarter 2024 sales ""only"" rose 30% or so while same-store sales were up just 2.3%. Obviously, 30% sales growth is still very strong, but the 2.3% same-store figure is respectable for a fast-food company, though nowhere near as enticing as 18%. But if Cava can keep expanding its store count and just maintain that low-single-digit same-store sales growth, it will still be a very fast-growing restaurant chain. And that, in a nutshell, is the investment thesis. There's one small problem, though. Cava is a very young company, having only held its IPO in mid-2023. Given that the P/E ratio is a massive 225, investors are clearly pricing in a lot of success in the years ahead (and probably looking at Chipotle to gauge its long-term potential). If the company lives up to expectations, it could be well worth the price and risk. If not, well, Wall Street is littered with restaurants that have crashed and burned. The bottom line: There's more long-term growth opportunity with Cava than there is with Chipotle. But that opportunity is far from certain, which will make Cava most appropriate for aggressive growth investors. There are a few simple answers here and some more complex ones. For example, neither Chipotle nor Cava pay a dividend, so don't buy either if you are an income investor. And given the lofty P/E ratios, value investors may want to pass as well. But if you are a growth investor, you might find each of them of interest. The difference is going to be whether you want to pay up in a big way for potential growth from a company with a short operating history or pay up in a more modest way for potential growth from a company with a solid track record of expanding over time.

Since CAVA Group Inc (NYSE:CAVA) ranks 10th on the list, it deserves a deeper look. Jim Cramer last week talked about the decline of tech stocks after the latest CPI report, saying investors “abandoned” tech stocks like “rats from the sinking ship.” “It was titanic! They took their money and went all in on small and medium-sized companies we call the Russell 2000 because we got a much softer than expected consumer price index.” Cramer said that the latest CPI number shows inflation “has been beaten” and interest rates are “coming down.” The CNBC host said if we keep getting positive data, he won’t be surprised to see not one but two or three rate cuts this year. Cramer wondered how major tech companies could fall on the low inflation numbers, and answered his own question by saying that sometimes in the backdrop of lower bond yields stocks of companies that “need lower rates” can suddenly rise. “What happened today always happens when rates plunged,” Cramer said. However, Cramer said that there isn’t enough positive data available yet to keep supporting this rally of stocks that benefit from lower rates, adding that such short-term rallies last for about three days. Cramer predicted that big tech stocks will be back after a “few more plunging days.” For this article we watched several latest programs of Jim Cramer and picked 10 stocks he’s bullish on. With each company we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here ). Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 26 Jim Cramer has been bullish on restaurant chain CAVA Group Inc (NYSE:CAVA) lately and in a latest program reaffirmed his positive outlook on the stock. Over the past one month Cava shares have pulled back 6%, but Cramer thinks you should not “panic.” “Don’t panic, understand that they’re coming down, just as a sector rotation.” Last month, CAVA Group Inc (NYSE:CAVA) reported upbeat Q1 results and hiked full-year guidance. CAVA Group Inc (NYSE:CAVA) now sees 2024 restaurant comparable sales growth of 4.5% to 6.5%, compared with the consensus estimate of +4.5%. Adjusted EBITDA guidance was increased to $100 million to $105 million from a prior outlook for $86.0 million to $92.0 million.

While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter? Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Cava Group (CAVA). Cava currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.89, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 14 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.89 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy. Of the 14 recommendations that derive the current ABR, seven are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 50% and 7.1% of all recommendations. Brokerage Recommendation Trends for CAVA Check price target & stock forecast for Cava here>>>

While the ABR calls for buying Cava, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential. Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation. This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements. Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision. Zacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR In spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures. Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.             ",

It's been on a tear as it picks up in popularity and investors see it as the next great restaurant chain. Cava is the Mediterranean answer to fast-casual dining. Customers love its fresh and healthy approach to food, with tasty dishes at an affordable price. Like other fast-casual chains, it targets a resilient population that has discretionary income and can afford takeout despite inflation. Its healthier concept also resonates with affluent millennials who are into health and fitness. Cava is still a small outfit, with only 323 stores as of the end of the 2024 first quarter. But it has entered several states already and demonstrated relevance in different regions. That's enough for investors to be confident that it can pull off a huge expansion and grow their investments several times over. Revenue increases are still coming mostly from new stores. Cava opened 14 new stores in the first quarter, and revenue increased 30.3% year over year. Same-store sales increased only 2.3%, a huge drop from previous quarters. Management has cautioned shareholders several times that the previously higher same-store sales figures included some hype related to the company's initial public offering (IPO). That's finally drying up. It's something to keep an eye on, but there are so many other good things happening at Cava that the lower same-store sales growth didn't steal the spotlight. Cava reported net income of $14 million in the first quarter after a $2.1 million loss last year. It also reported its first quarter of positive free cash flow of $4.7 million. If investors learned anything from the previous bear market, they should have learned that stock prices can't go up forever, at least if they're not based in reality. Cava looks like it could have stellar long-term potential, but its price continues to climb without enough underlying results. At the current price, Cava stock trades at a nosebleed forward one-year P/E ratio of 188. That prices in an incredible amount of growth, and I'm just not confident Cava can sustain that right now. Sure, Cava stock could continue to climb for some time, and if it reports strong second-quarter results, that's a likely scenario. But it looks like Cava's price is going to deflate at some point, and since you can't time the market, investors who don't do their due diligence could end up in a rough spot. If Cava doesn't report confidence-boosting second-quarter results, it could happen soon.         ",

Two leading fast casual restaurant chains are Mediterranean-inspired CAVA Group (NYSE: CAVA) and burrito specialist Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG). So far in 2024, Cava stock is up 98% while shares of Chipotle have gained 25% -- each handily topping the S&P 500. Let's dive into the business results of Cava and Chipotle and assess which stock might be the better buy for long-term investors. When analyzing restaurant businesses, metrics such as new store openings and same-store sales can be useful. During Cava's first fiscal quarter of 2024 (ended April 21), the company opened 14 net new restaurants. This represented 23% growth year over year, and brought Cava's total restaurant count to 323. The company's revenue soared 30% year over year during Q1 to $256.3 million, while same-store sales rose by 2.3%. Despite a macroeconomic environment battling stubborn inflation, Cava has also showcased a commitment to strong unit economics. For the period ended April 21, Cava reported net income of $14 million, compared to a loss of $2.1 million last year. Moreover, the company's adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) essentially doubled year over year during Q1, while free cash flow swung to $4.7 million compared to cash burn of $13.4 million last year. All things considered, Cava's financial profile is quite impressive. However, with the stock surging 98% so far in 2024, investors need to assess the company's valuation. As seen in the chart above, Cava's price-to-sales (P/S) multiple of 11.7 is considerably above Chipotle's. In a way, this could make some sense. Chipotle is a much more mature business compared to Cava. However, the valuation disparity between the two restaurant stocks is hard to overlook. Let's dig into Chipotle's business and see whether Cava's premium valuation is deserved. For the quarter ended March 31, Chipotle reported revenue of $2.7 billion -- an increase of 14.1% year over year. While this level of revenue growth is only about half as much as Cava's during the first quarter, Chipotle is clearly a much larger business, considering that its revenue is more than 10-fold that of Cava's. Where Chipotle really sets itself apart from the competition is same-store sales and profit margins. During Q1, Chipotle's comparable restaurant sales rose 7% -- more than triple Cava's sales. The company's restaurant level operating margin was 27.5%. In comparison, Cava's restaurant level profit margin was 25.2%.             ",

Is It Too Late to Buy?,"Cava Group (NYSE: CAVA) stock has electrified investors as one of the most exciting initial public offerings (IPOs) in a recent dry spell. Its healthy Mediterranean menu is attracting customers while its stock attracts investing dollars. Cava stock is already up 96% this year. Is there still time to buy into this growth story? Cava could be the next Chipotle Mexican Grill, and considering Chipotle's massive stock run, investors want to get into Cava stock early. Cava operates a similar model to Chipotle, offering healthy, fast-casual fare that uses a limited number of ingredients, like harissa, tzatziki, and lamb meatballs, and is easily replicable across stores. So far, it's a hit in the regions it's already entered, which is throughout the southern part of the country. It only has 323 restaurants as of the end of the first quarter, but it believes it can succeed throughout the U.S. As it continues to expand, it looks like a no-brainer for growing revenue and scaling. Most of its growth is coming from new stores. Total revenue increased 30% year over year in the 2024 first quarter, and same-store sales were up 2.3%, a sharp deceleration. Management had previously said that its strong same-store sales growth was aided by the hype surrounding its IPO, and while that lasted for a while, it's over. However, it's still reporting positive same-store sales during a pretty rough time, which is impressive, even though it's slowing down. The likelihood is that same-store sales will accelerate under improved operating conditions. Cava is scaling efficiently and has been reporting increasing profits. Net income was $14 million in the first quarter after a $2 million loss last year, and it reported a full-year profit of $13 million in 2023. The company is exceeding its own expectations, and management raised guidance across measures after the first-quarter report. It's expecting 5.5% same-store sales growth, raised from 4%, and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) of around $103 million, raised from $89 million. Cava stock jumped after the report. It may also have benefited from Chipotle's recent stock split. Since investors see Cava as the next Chipotle, hype around Chipotle probably trickled down to Cava stock, too. It sounds great, right? For the most part, yes. But there could be a few holes in the investing thesis. One is valuation. Cava stock has an astronomical valuation, and it will take some time to grow into that, even if everything goes right in the business.           ",

Buffett famously said, “The stock market is a device to transfer money from the ‘impatient’ to the ‘patient.'” While patience is certainly a virtue when it comes to investing, it also helps to identify strong companies when they first come to market and take a position early in their life as a publicly traded concern. This is when companies are experiencing rapid growth and have a long runway ahead of them. Spotting winning overlooked growth stocks, taking a position early and holding on for the long-term is a recipe for success as an investor. Here are three overlooked growth stocks for patient investors. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Source: Nicole Glass Photography / Shutterstock.com Mediterranean restaurant chain Cava Group (NYSE:CAVA) has only been publicly traded for a year but has enjoyed an incredible run. Since its initial public offering (IPO) in June 2023, CAVA stock has increased 150%. The company is also profitable and has reported financial results that consistently top Wall Street forecasts. This makes Cava Group one of the most successful IPOs of the last five years. The company’s strong financial results are driven by huge growth, which continues to create an enormous market opportunity. For this year’s first quarter, Cava reported EPS of 13 cents, more than double the 5 cents expected among analysts. Revenue in the quarter totaled $259 million, ahead of Wall Street expectations for $246 million. Sales were up 30% from a year earlier. Much of the growth came from Cava’s rapid expansion as the company opened 14 new
restaurant locations during the quarter, bringing its national count to 323 outlets. According to management, Cava is now forecasting full-year earnings of $100 million to $105 million. That’s an increase from an earlier forecast of $86 million to $92 million. Many analysts compare Cava to Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG). Source: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com If there’s one stock that has had an even more impressive market debut than Cava Group, it’s British microchip and semiconductor concern Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM). Since going public in September 2023, ARM stock has risen 200%. And more gains appear likely. The growth trajectory of ARM stock has been so strong that the company was just added to the Nasdaq 100 index, replacing satellite radio provider Sirius XM (NASDAQ:SIRI).         ",
116,2024-10-13 16:04:08,2024-07-02 15:50:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-stocks-double-again-2024-155000940.html,Yahoo Finance,3 Stocks That Can Double Again in 2024,"There are just a little more than 30 U.S. exchange-listed companies with market caps greater than $1 billion that more than doubled in the first half of this year. It's fair to say that most of them won't repeat the feat through the final six months of 2024. It doesn't mean that all of them won't deliver an encore performance. Cava (NYSE: CAVA), Hims & Hers Health (NYSE: HIMS), and Sweetgreen (NYSE: SG) are among handful of names that have already doubled this year. They have a shot at doubling again before the end of 2024. Let's take a closer look. Investors are often smart to steer clear of freshly minted IPOs, but Cava has proven to be a tasty exception to the rule. The fast-growing chain of Mediterranean fast-casual restaurants went public at $22 in the springtime of last year. It nearly doubled to $42.98 by the end of 2023. It has gone on to more than double this year, a four-bagger for those who got in on the IPO less than 13 months ago. Cava closed out its latest fiscal quarter with 323 locations, but it's less than a third of the way to its goal of having 1,000 locations open by 2032. The brand's growing appeal and some of its unique product offerings have also translated well to the upscale grocery level as a seller of consumer packaged goods. Growth and top-line store-level performance have slowed since Cava's first quarter as a public company when revenue soared 62% on the strength of brisk expansion and an 18.2% jump in comparable-store sales. Revenue in its latest report rose 30%, fueled largely by a 23% surge in its open locations. Comps rose a mere 2.3%, and a closer look could prove problematic. The modest comps figure is the result of a 3.5% increase from menu price and product mix, weighed down by a 1.2% decline in guest traffic. This isn't as problematic as it seems. For starters, Cava's scalability has scored it better-than-expected profitability in every quarter as a public company. Its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) nearly doubled in its latest quarter. Watching a hot chain go through a slowdown in traffic can be scary, but Cava actually raised its guidance when it announced its first-quarter results in late May. It was initially eyeing a 3% to 5% increase for the entire 2024 fiscal year. Now it's eyeing a 4.5% to 6.5% increase. Put another way, business is expected to pick up again at the store level to give the aggressive chain expansion more oomph. The promise of telehealth is a win-win on paper. Using videoconferencing to connect someone requiring a medical consultation with a licensed or trained professional is cheaper, faster, and more discreet than conventional in-office visitations. However, the medium has generally failed to deliver profitable and sustainable growth. Hims & Hers Health could be the exception. Hims was founded seven years ago, initially leaning on telehealth to sell hair loss and erectile dysfunction treatments that require a medical prescription. It would go on to double its target audience by launching Hers, offering birth control and flibanserin. It would eventually tackle mental health, and earlier this year it became a source to secure the wildly popular GLP-1 weight loss injections. Growth has been stellar. Revenue gains have clocked in at 46% or better for every quarter since the company went public three years ago. It has finally broken out of the red, clocking in with back-to-back quarters of profitable results. There are regulatory risks here if there's a crackdown on telehealth prescriptions, but it may be too late to put that genie back in the bottle. Let's close out with another fast-growing restaurant chain. In a year in which tech and crypto dominate the names of stocks that doubled, Sweetgreen is living up to its name for its fortunate 2024 investors. The company's fast-casual eateries specializing in premium salads and warm bowls are rocking, and the stock's 167% year-to-date burst makes it one of 2024's biggest consumer-facing gainers. Unlike Cava, Sweetgreen was a dud after its initial IPO pop. It went public at $28 in 2021, briefly trading north of $50 before whittling its way down to the high single digits by late last year. The starting line matters here. Sweetgreen is growing roughly in line with Cava these days. Revenue rose 26% in its latest quarter on a 5% uptick in comps. However, it's still not profitable. The catalyst for continued growth here is similar to what could drive Cava higher. These are high-end fast casual concepts that appeal to young and affluent professionals. The return to in-office work should continue to drive weekday lunch traffic to both chains, and brand appeal should only continue to grow as the year plays out.

Since CAVA Group Inc (NYSE:CAVA) ranks 9th on the list, it deserves a deeper look. Jim Cramer in a latest program discussed the changing consumer trends in the US, wondering whether the consumer is just “fed up” of paying high prices and becoming “frugal.” Cramer said this “frugal thesis” is not “obvious” but he has recognized this latest trend based on some new developments. Cramer named a few consumer companies that are benefitting from the changing consumer behavior because of their discounted price offerings. Cramer rejected the notion that dollar stores are cheap. He said these stores raise prices “aggressively” and calling them dollar stores has become a “misnomer.” The CNBC host said the consumers “want prices lower” and that’s why dollar store companies are getting crushed in the new environment. Jim Cramer also said the “renting society” is winning the “owning society,” pointing to a new trend where consumers are renting boats instead of buying them to enjoy the experience without spending a fortune. For this article we watched several latest programs of Jim Cramer aired on CNBC and picked some stocks he’s recommending investors to buy or sell. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Here is what Cramer said during a latest program” ” CAVA feels like it has the possibility of being a Chipotle.” Cramer said he knows the stock had a “big spike” recently, but he’d buy more CAVA Group Inc (NYSE:CAVA) shares if the stock comes down. Last month, CAVA Group Inc (NYSE:CAVA) reported upbeat Q1 results and hiked full-year guidance. CAVA Group Inc (NYSE:CAVA) now sees 2024 restaurant comparable sales growth of 4.5% to 6.5%, compared with the consensus estimate of +4.5%. Adjusted EBITDA guidance was increased to $100 million to $105 million from a prior outlook for $86.0 million to $92.0 million.

It's easier said than done, but doing your homework can give you an edge on the standard portfolio of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) these days. Here are three stocks that have beaten the S&P 500 that I think can do it again over time. An investment gem for years, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) was in the news a few weeks ago for becoming more valuable than Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT). The company has outpaced the S&P 500 by 234% over the last five years. It is one of Warren Buffett's favorites, and for good reason. Its products have lots of utility, and the phone and computer businesses have a significant barrier to entry. You need deep pockets and infrastructure to get involved in this game. Naysayers to my Apple pick will likely point to last year's 2.8% decline in revenue and the weak first quarter of 2024. What I think is being missed here is the potential demand that Apple could create from the integration of AI-based programs into its products. Most recently, the chatter around Apple has been its announcement of Apple Intelligence, its planned AI business, and potential partnership with Meta Platforms on generative AI. This could be exactly what Apple needs to gain the momentum seen by stocks such as Nvidia, whose semiconductor chips are essential to AI-based businesses. I like Apple as a play on this burgeoning business, since it stands to be a new source of demand for the tech company. It has the product lineup necessary to implement AI in a way that will appeal to its large consumer base. As I said before, Apple's devices offer a lot of utility. Integrating AI into them only stands to increase that advantage. Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ: COST) is a blue chip gem. The discount king creates consistent annual growth and earnings for shareholders, and its low-price strategy positions it well in our inflationary economy, where consumers are looking for the best deals. Charlie Munger, Warren Buffett's late partner, loved Costco, and it's easy to see why. It has outpaced the S&P 500 by 134% over the last five years, using a strong member base that drives comparable store sales (comps). In the first 16 weeks of the company's fiscal year, total comps increased by 4.7%, with a 12.6% increase in e-commerce. May sales results showed comps gained 6.4%, with e-commerce sales gaining 15.3%. Those figures don't match Nvidia's, but the key here is consistency and profitability over time, and a business model that is beneficial to consumers at any time. Costco has averaged double-digit revenue growth over the last five years, just a part of years of revenue and net earnings increases, and there seems to be little sign that the story will change.

This move outpaced the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.41%. Elsewhere, the Dow saw a downswing of 0.12%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq depreciated by 0.71%. Heading into today, shares of the Mediterranean restaurant chain had lost 1.7% over the past month, lagging the Retail-Wholesale sector's gain of 2.65% and the S&P 500's gain of 3.53% in that time. The investment community will be closely monitoring the performance of Cava Group in its forthcoming earnings report. The company's earnings per share (EPS) are projected to be $0.12, reflecting a 42.86% decrease from the same quarter last year. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $219.47 million, up 26.94% from the year-ago period. For the entire fiscal year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $0.34 per share and a revenue of $903.42 million, representing changes of +61.9% and +23.98%, respectively, from the prior year. Furthermore, it would be beneficial for investors to monitor any recent shifts in analyst projections for Cava Group. These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. Consequently, upward revisions in estimates express analysts' positivity towards the company's business operations and its ability to generate profits. Our research suggests that these changes in estimates have a direct relationship with upcoming stock price performance. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank.

Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important? Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Cava Group (CAVA) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage. Cava currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.89, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 14 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.89 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy. Of the 14 recommendations that derive the current ABR, seven are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 50% and 7.1% of all recommendations. Brokerage Recommendation Trends for CAVA Check price target & stock forecast for Cava here>>>

While the ABR calls for buying Cava, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential. Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation. In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement. Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision. ABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank In spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures. Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.             ",

Legendary investor Peter Lynch earned 29% annualized returns as a mutual fund manager in the 1980s. He was famous for his shopping-mall investment strategy, where he would buy stakes in emerging brands before they were household names. As these small companies grew into larger ones, the stock price followed. The stock market hands these opportunities to investors all the time. Every decade sees several new restaurant and retail brands emerge that have the potential for wealth-building gains. For example, $10,000 invested in Lululemon Athletica in 2010 would be worth $92,000 today. The same amount invested in Chipotle Mexican Grill in the same year would be worth $152,000. Here are two stocks that Lynch might love today and could rapidly expand your portfolio in the decades to come. Cava Group (NYSE: CAVA) is a fast-growing chain of Mediterranean-style restaurants that is showing it just might follow in the footsteps of Chipotle and other successful restaurant stocks that have come before it. Over the past year, Cava shares have significantly outpaced the S&P 500, rocketing 126%. Consumer spending has been a little soft of late, which is reflected in Cava's relatively soft same-restaurant sales (comps) growth of 2.3% in the first quarter. But comps have increased 30.7% on a two-year basis, showing this new restaurant concept is resonating. Cava is succeeding by using concepts similar to Chipotle's, including fresh food delivered with speed and efficiency. The company is starting to use artificial intelligence (AI) to improve order accuracy and boost service speed, which indicates room for improvement in financial performance. The chain's growth so far is pointing to a huge opportunity. There were 323 Cava restaurants open through the first quarter, and management is targeting 1,000 by 2032. That would triple its annual revenue over the next decade, not counting added growth from customer traffic at existing stores. What's exciting about the opportunity is that a chain of 1,000 restaurants is still quite small relative to industry-leading restaurant brands. If Cava eventually opens 3,500 stores, like Chipotle has, the stock could deliver exceptional returns. Dutch Bros (NYSE: BROS) is another rapidly growing chain with a small footprint of stores, or ""shops"" as the company calls them, and more than half of the U.S. to expand into from here. Its menu features a range of specialty beverages, such as coffees, lemonade, shakes, and smoothies, and it is winning over customers with a well-trained, friendly staff.            ",

Will it be enough to boost their lagging stocks?,"Value is on the menu this summer. Restaurant chains such as Taco Bell (YUM), McDonald’s (MCD), KFC, and Burger King (QSR) have been leaning into value deals this summer in hopes of getting Americans to visit their restaurants more often and spend more when they do. It's an attempt to turn around the narrative that fast food has gotten too expensive. Quick-service restaurant sales have finally started to flag after chains hiked prices over the past few years to offset higher labor and commodity costs, deterring diners, especially lower-income consumers. That shift has been reflected in the hit to restaurant stocks this year. Shares of McDonald's and Wendy's (WEN) are both down 13% year to date, while shares of Burger King parent Restaurant Brands International are down 11.3% and YUM! Brands is up just 1%. Starbucks (SBUX), which calls itself an affordable luxury, is now struggling to encourage investors it still is, with shares down 18% in 2024. The S&P 500 (^GSPC), meanwhile, is up nearly 15%. Enter value meals — which Wall Street pros say could boost foot traffic but lower margins. Many will be watching closely throughout July, which Evercore ISI analyst David Palmer called a ""pivotal month for the fast food industry,"" for proof that the ""$5 meal bundle is enough to accelerate industry sales."" The limited-time value deal comes down to a simple proposition: When value strategies work, it's because increased foot traffic offsets lower margins to bring in more dollars, Morningstar analyst Sean Dunlop said. Consumers adding more items to their checks also helps. “It really comes down to … repeat visits after the fact,” R.J. Hottovy, head of analytical research at Placer.ai, told Yahoo Finance. “You're not making money on the value menu. You're making menu money on the other products, the more premium products, the dessert products, the beverage products that go along with that.” While consumers may be happy about the cheaper prices, it's not guaranteed to be a good deal for fast food companies. And more competitors in the value arena could lead to no clear winner in the end. ""A value war is good for no one,"" Dunlop said. ""It's also the typical reaction that we see when industry traffic slows down. ... Everyone's dominant strategy when traffic is down is to promote, discount, and lean into value, but all players lose if their peers also make that choice."" On Thursday, Taco Bell was the latest quick-service restaurant to introduce a value offering. With a name that plays on the idea that fast food is now a luxury, the $7 Luxe Box menu includes a Chalupa Supreme taco, beefy five-layer burrito, double-stacked taco, chips and nacho cheese sauce, and a medium drink.

In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company. No shareholder likes losing money on their investments, especially institutional investors who saw their holdings drop 3.8% in value last week. However, the 117% one-year return to shareholders might have softened the blow. But they would probably be wary of future losses. In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of CAVA Group. See our latest analysis for CAVA Group Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing. We can see that CAVA Group does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at CAVA Group's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters. Since institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences.

CAVA surpassed resistance at the 20-day moving average, suggesting a short-term bullish trend. The 20-day simple moving average is a well-liked trading tool because it provides a look back at a stock's price over a 20-day period. Additionally, short-term traders find this SMA very beneficial, as it smooths out short-term price trends and shows more trend reversal signals than longer-term moving averages. Like other SMAs, if a stock's price is moving above the 20-day, the trend is considered positive. When the price falls below the moving average, it can signal a downward trend. CAVA has rallied 13% over the past four weeks, and the company is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at the moment. This combination suggests CAVA could be on the verge of another move higher. Once investors consider CAVA's positive earnings estimate revisions, the bullish case only solidifies. No earnings estimate has been lowered in the past two months, compared to 7 raised estimates, for the current fiscal year, and the consensus estimate has increased as well. Investors should think about putting CAVA on their watchlist given the ultra-important technical indicator and positive move in earnings estimate revisions.

One important consideration for finding a great investment opportunity is to give more credence to the underlying business than to the stock price. Another is to diversify your holdings. When investing for the long term, put your cash (whether it's a large amount or a relatively small investment of $500) into companies across a range of sectors. This will help you expand your portfolio steadily with time while ensuring that you're not overly reliant on a single type of business. If you have $500 to invest in stocks right now, here are two top growth stocks to that can help diversify your holdings. Hims & Hers (NYSE: HIMS) is an online healthcare business that helps users access virtual care services, prescriptions, and even over-the-counter drugs all from a remote location. Operating in the U.S. and the U.K., Hims & Hers currently focuses its services on hair loss prevention, dermatology, mental health, sexual health, and weight loss. It provides a platform for patients to make online appointments with a licensed healthcare professional who can diagnose potential issues and prescribe medications if needed. Prescriptions are then fulfilled through licensed partner pharmacies. Platform users can also subscribe to receive recurring deliveries of various over-the-counter products they need. Hims & Hers also provides users with wellness content, educational programs, and other information to assist in their health journey. Most of the company's revenue is subscription-based, but it also makes some of its revenue from non-prescription product sales derived from retailers with whom it has wholesale purchase agreements. The company originally started with a focus on men's wellness, offering solutions for conditions like hair loss and erectile dysfunction. It's since expanded into women's health, now offering healthcare consumers access to products and services across a range of practice areas. Hims & Hers partners with an extensive network of licensed healthcare providers while also offering a platform that features cloud pharmacy fulfillment, digital prescriptions, and an electronic medical records system. Healthcare consumers increasingly want the ease and flexibility of telehealth options. Hims & Hers makes the process seamless, from speaking with your healthcare provider to getting a prescription to enjoying free shipping of the product to your front door. More recently, the company expanded its footprint to include weight loss treatments. In a time where treatments like Novo Nordisk's Wegovy (Ozempic is the version approved for diabetes) and Eli Lilly's Zepbound are raking in billions, Hims & Hers recently announced that it would now offer access to GLP-1 injections in addition to weight management oral medication kits. These compounded GLP-1s purport to include the same active ingredient as Wegovy at lower costs than the branded medications.                ",

Some fast-casual chains, such as Cava Group (NYSE:CAVA), are soaring to new all-time highs. At the same time, other restaurant operators are seeing their shares careen to new multi-year lows. Restaurants are a competitive field, and not all of the beaten-down chains will see a significant recovery. That’s especially true as inflation and a slowing economy are starting to strain consumers’ wallets. However, these three restaurant stocks to buy near 52-week-lows are compelling values that are set to heat up in the coming months. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Source: eunyoung / Shutterstock.com Portillo’s (NASDAQ:PTLO) is a small restaurant chain that specializes in Chicago-style foods such as hot dogs, sausages, Italian beef sandwiches, and milkshakes. The company went public with just 67 locations in nine states. Investors have reasonably questioned how well the company’s distinct menu will work outside of its already established core markets, such as the Chicago area. However, Portillo’s is pressing on with aggressive growth plans, adding locations in fast-growing states such as Texas, Florida and Arizona. If these new locations pay off for Portillo’s, it’d be a total game-changer, converting it from a regional outfit to a nationwide player. And while the company is fairly small, it is already reporting positive earnings per share. It remains to be seen how Portillo’s will ultimately play out. However, with the stock down nearly 50% over the past year, a value opportunity has appeared even as revenues continue to grow at a reasonable rate. Analysts also agree, with Portillo’s being tabbed as a consensus strong buy pick in the restaurant space. Source: Shutterstock Dine Brands (NYSE:DIN) is a holding company that operates several restaurant concepts, including Applebee’s, IHOP, and Fuzzy’s Taco Shop. The company primarily operates via a franchising model, meaning that it collects a percentage of sales from its franchise store partners. This insulates Dine from economic volatility, as the underlying store operators, not the parent company, have the most exposure to near-term economic swings. Due to the sticking power of the Applebee’s and IHOP brands, Dine has sailed through various economic and political shocks over the decades. The company is in another down cycle, with DIN stock falling 35% over the past year. This comes as Dine estimates that revenues will be up about 1% this year. That’s not great, especially in these inflationary times, but it’s hardly a business meltdown either.             ",

So it is no surprise to see Wall Street fawning over restaurant upstart Cava (NYSE: CAVA). The Mediterranean fast-casual concept that has modeled itself after the likes of Chipotle and Sweetgreen has seen its stock soar more than 100% in less than six months to start 2024. It is growing locations quickly and building an ardent fan base around the country. What's next for Cava stock? Can it rise even further? Time to investigate and find out. Cava sells Mediterranean-style food such as hummus, pita bread, and harissa chicken. It allows customers to create their own bowls and sandwiches with a variety of 38 ingredients, meaning there are countless combinations that customers can build with their orders. With no scaled restaurant chain across the United States, Cava has a ton of white space ahead of it to build a national brand. At the end of last quarter, the company had 323 locations, up 23% year over year. Each restaurant generates $2.6 million in revenue annually, a number that is also growing year over year. Even better, Cava is growing while still generating a profit. It posted a restaurant-level profit margin of 25.2% in the first quarter of 2024 and $19 million in consolidated operating income over the last 12 months. With strong unit economics, it looks like this company can self-fund its growth while still remaining profitable. With just over 300 locations in the United States, Cava has plenty of room to keep growing. For reference, Chipotle has more than 3,000 locations and thinks it can eventually double that number. This year, Cava expects to open at least 50 new restaurants. If it can keep up this pace and then slowly accelerate unit-count as it scales up, Cava should have around 1,000 locations within 10 years. On just its current average unit volume (AUV) for each restaurant, that equates to $2.6 billion in annual revenue, compared to $655 million over the last 12 months. Assuming some benefit from same-store sales growth -- which has been positive every quarter since Cava went public -- and AUV could hit $3.5 million or higher. That equates to $3.5 billion in revenue. Although $3.5 billion in revenue within 10 years sounds exciting, that has no bearing on whether the stock is cheap today. Investors need to relate this number with Cava's current market capitalization, which is $10.5 billion after rising more than 100% this year. That is a trailing price-to-sales ratio (P/S) of more than 10, which is quite expensive for a restaurant concept.            ",

Its success has led to a gain of more than 110-fold over the last 18 years and, subsequently, an upcoming 50-for-1 stock split. Some hope Cava Group (NYSE: CAVA) is a second-chance stock for those who missed out on Chipotle. Like Chipotle, it is a rapidly expanding restaurant chain specializing in healthy fast food. Nonetheless, investors also have good reason to believe that Cava will not follow in Chipotle's footsteps. Before assuming Cava is the next Chipotle, investors should consider three factors explaining why they might still want to choose Chipotle over Cava Group stock. Chipotle stock's success, which dates back to its initial public offering (IPO) in 2006, is a factor investors should not ignore. Indeed, investors may not realize exactly what the company has accomplished. For every Chipotle, the market has numerous stocks like Red Robin Gourmet Burgers that have lost value over its trading history. An unproven stock like Cava could suffer the same fate, so investors have to be careful. Moreover, Chipotle based its food on the popular Mexican food genre, likely contributing to its popularity. Additionally, it focused on fresh ingredients and showed it could offer fast, popular food without compromising health benefits. The fact that it was the first major fast-food chain to succeed with such an approach has likely helped boost Chipotle's stock over time. Furthermore, it may surprise investors that Chipotle may still hold more growth potential despite its nearly 3,500 restaurants. For one, investors should consider Cava's stated goals. It hopes to expand to 1,000 restaurants by 2032 from the 323 locations it operated as of the end of its first quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended April 21), which would approximately triple its number of restaurants. In contrast, Chipotle plans 7,000 locations in North America. That amounts to about double the current number. However, unlike Cava, which has never announced an international expansion plan, Chipotle has locations in Canada and three European countries. If it succeeds in Europe, Chipotle could grow more in absolute numbers and percentage terms. McDonald's, for example, operates in more than 100 countries. Additionally, those who hope Cava is the ""second-chance Chipotle"" are in good company if valuations are an indication. Cava stock has more than doubled in value since its IPO, and as a newly profitable company, its P/E ratio approaching 1,000 does not meaningfully reflect its valuation. Nonetheless, Cava is an expensive stock by nearly any measure.            ",
132,2024-10-13 16:04:15,2024-06-15 08:54:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/could-investing-10-000-cava-085400630.html,Yahoo Finance,"Could Investing $10,000 in Cava Make You a Millionaire?","Cava Group (NYSE: CAVA) is often compared to Chipotle Mexican Grill. It's an apt comparison given the operating model of the two restaurant chains. But it also hints at the long-term opportunity for Cava if it can keep expanding its store base. Cava could be a key part of a millionaire-making portfolio, but it's still a stock you'll want to treat with a bit of caution. Like Chipotle, Cava's business model is to offer freshly prepared fast casual food via an assembly line style creation process. Perhaps the biggest difference between the two restaurants is that Chipotle makes Mexican food and Cava makes Mediterranean food. But in this comparison is the hint of long-term opportunity. Chipotle Mexican Grill has around 3,500 locations. Cava ended the first quarter of 2024 with just 323 locations. A little math will tell you that there's room for Cava to grow its footprint tenfold if you believe it has the same opportunity ahead of it as Chipotle. Even if Cava can't get that big, it still looks like there's a long runway for growth ahead. For example, in the first quarter Cava opened 14 new locations. That rounds up to around 60 new locations a year. At that pace, it would take 50 years to open 3,000 new restaurants. That's back-of-the-envelope math and doesn't take into consideration an increased ability to open new locations over time as the company grows in scale. But it further highlights that Cava is still in the early stages of exploiting its potential growth opportunity. With that as a mindset, and looking at the massive stock appreciation of Chipotle as it grew its business, investing $10,000 in Cava could very clearly be a key piece of a millionaire-making portfolio. That said, even with what looks like a huge opportunity ahead, it probably wouldn't be wise to back up the truck to load it up with Cava stock. There are some very important warning signs to consider with up-and-coming restaurant brands. For starters, consumers love new things and early indications of demand aren't always good indications of long-term demand. For example, Cava's same-store sales in 2023 came in at a white-hot 17.9%! That's impressive, but it just isn't a sustainable figure over the long term. It was most likely driven by newfound attention for the Cava brand. And that is proven by the fact that same-store growth in the first quarter of 2024 was just 2.3%. Before you run for the hills, 2.3% isn't bad. It's just OK. But it does look terrible when compared to 17.9%. What investors need to monitor here is how same-store sales trend in the future. If same-store sales dip into negative territory for an extended period it would suggest that Cava is growing its store footprint at the expense of its existing locations. Basically, new locations are either cannibalizing the old ones, or, worse, management is so focused on opening restaurants that the operation of the existing stores suffers from a lack of attention. This happens with painful frequency in the restaurant business. Cava looks like it has a huge amount of growth potential. The question is really around whether or not management can execute effectively enough to live up to that potential. There's a chance it can, but there's also a chance it can't.

This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates, which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices. The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company's changing earnings picture. The Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years is tracked by the system. Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time. In these situations, the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements. Therefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for Cava basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price. Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices The change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock. For Cava, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher. Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

While growth investors can sometimes buy up a stock based on that hype, there's the risk that reality doesn't quite align with those expectations. If that happens, it can set up a stock for a sell-off in the future. Cava Group (NYSE: CAVA) has often been compared to Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG), which has been a terrific business to invest in. In five years, investors have collected massive 340% returns from Chipotle, so it's easy to see why Cava investors may be optimistic about the much smaller stock's potential upside. But based on its latest earnings numbers, there could be some cause for concern, as Cava may not be living up to those high expectations. Last month, Cava released its most recent earnings numbers for the three-month period that ended April 21. Cava's revenue rose by more than 30% to $256.3 million. That's decent top-line growth, but it can be a bit misleading as the company relies heavily on new store openings. A key metric for restaurants is the comparable sales growth number. This looks at how much more revenue an existing restaurant is generating compared to a year ago. This effectively excludes the impact of new restaurant openings. And Cava's same-restaurant sales growth was just 2.3%. That's far lower than the 11.4% same-restaurant growth it generated in the previous three-month period. And for 2023, the growth rate was even higher at 17.9%. Even the more established Chipotle reported comparable restaurant sales growth of 7% for the first three months of 2024. For Cava, this is a problem when you consider its high valuation. Investors have been bullish on Cava stock so far in 2024 as its 104% returns dwarfed Chipotle's 35% gains. Cava is still very modest in comparison -- its near-$10 billion market cap is about 11% of Chipotle's $87 billion valuation. But it's also a riskier investment, given that Cava struggles with profitability. In its most recent quarter, Cava's operating income totaled $14.2 million and was just 5.5% of revenue. Chipotle, by comparison, posted an operating margin of 16.8% in its most recent results. Cava's business may continue to improve over time, but there could be challenges ahead if the company relies heavily on expansion, which is costlier than if the company were simply growing organically through stronger same-restaurant sales numbers.

Shares will often cool off after the initial public offering (IPO) frenzy fades, but that hasn't happened here. The stock is up a whopping 103% already. Early success makes it difficult to determine whether it's wise to invest while the company's market cap is still modest at $10 billion or if the hype has already squeezed all the short-term investment returns out of shares. There's a lot to like about Cava looking years into the future. However, chasing shares here might not be the best idea. Here is why. Cava Group is a casual dining restaurant brand that serves fresh Mediterranean food. Today, the company has 323 stores spread throughout the lower half of the United States. Cava's West Coast presence is light, and the upper half of America is virtually untouched. Having so much room for store expansion paints a straightforward picture of future growth. Cava's popular comparison is the Mexican restaurant chain Chipotle Mexican Grill, which has 3,479 stores and is still rapidly expanding. The big question is whether consumer demand will support a similar expansion plan. Cava's management believes it will. Mediterranean food is known for being rich in healthy fats, featuring plant-based foods and lean protein. Management points to studies that indicate a Mediterranean diet will dramatically decrease the risk of early death from cardiovascular disease. Consumer interest is soaring, and the restaurant landscape for Mediterranean food is fragmented. Cava's financials are also promising. The company generated positive free cash flow in the fiscal first quarter, ended April 21, and analysts believe the business will be profitable this year. Currently, expectations are for $0.34 per share in net income. Add it all together, and Cava is a profitable business with a long runway ahead for steady top- and bottom-line growth. Wall Street's Cava stock craze puts a lofty valuation on the stock. Today, Cava stock trades at just over $85 per share. Assuming the company hits analyst earnings estimates for $0.34 per share, the stock trades at a forward price to earnings ratio of 250. Investors buying shares hope rapid earnings growth will quickly whittle that valuation down. But will it? Consider this. Business models matter. For example, a software company can dramatically expand profit margins with revenue growth because it has a relatively fixed amount of expenses. Eventually, revenue can rapidly outgrow business expenses. That means high-octane earnings growth.               ",

This week I'm feeling a little bit hungry so we have two food related names to review. Cava Group CAVA is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and is a Mediterranean fast casual restaurant chain that has seen a great run over the last few months. The company has been posting some good results and has been expanding margins of late even as food prices have continued to move higher. In the video, we review the earnings history, earnings estimate revisions, growth projections and valuation. The idea with CAVA is that there is a very high valuation and the question becomes can they keep expanding margins. If they do, the current valuation can be supported but a turnaround in the area could mean big trouble. Vital Farms VITL is also a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and it sports the growth divergence that I love to see. When there is a strong Zacks Style Score for Growth and a weak Zacks Style Score for Value, I know I am on the right path. In the video I mentioned that the price of eggs has been moving steadily higher over the last few years.

While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter? Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Cava Group (CAVA) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage. Cava currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.89, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 14 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.89 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy. Of the 14 recommendations that derive the current ABR, seven are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 50% and 7.1% of all recommendations. Brokerage Recommendation Trends for CAVA Check price target & stock forecast for Cava here>>>

While the ABR calls for buying Cava, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential. Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations. This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements. Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision. Zacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR In spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures. The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.             ",

They have a lot in common, and both are reporting strong performance. But which one is the better buy today? Cava operates a chain of restaurants offering healthy, Mediterranean fast-casual fare. It's popular so far, and it's been compared to mega-chain Chipotle Mexican Grill. Considering the outstanding success of Chipotle, Cava looks like it could be a great stock candidate that is just getting started. It's only been on the market for about one year, and in the four quarters it's reported, it has demonstrated growth and increasing profits. Revenue increased 30% in the 2024 first quarter to $256 million. Comparable sales rose 2.3%, which is a sharp slowdown. Management had said that previously high comps growth was partially due to the hype surrounding the IPO. It's decelerating as expected, especially as inflation makes its own impact. However, management is expecting comparable sales to tick up, guiding for a 5.5% increase at the midpoint for the full year. Profitability was strong in the first quarter. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) doubled year over year to $33.3 million, and net income soared from $2.1 million to $14 million. Free cash flow was $4.7 million. Cava opened 14 new stores for a total of 323, and it plans to open around 50 for the full year. It sees the opportunity to operate as many as 1,000 stores over the next eight years or so. Management sees a strong network effect as it scales, with each successive opening leading to more buzz, brand amplification, higher engagement, and increasing sales. Dutch Bros is a coffee chain concentrated on the West Coast but expanding across the country. It can be compared to Starbucks because it does offer similar beverages, but it has cultivated a unique style and culture that's attracting loyal fans. It has been a public company for nearly three years, and although there have been some hiccups along its journey, it's in a solid place and only getting better. Revenue increased 39% in the first quarter to $275 million, driven by a 10% increase in comparable sales. That's an important improvement, since comps growth had decelerated and even turned negative in last year's first quarter. Adjusted EBITDA increased 120% to $52 million, and net income was $16.2 million, up from a $9.4 million loss last year. It opened 45 new stores and plans to open up to 165 for the year. It operates 876 stores right now and sees the opportunity to open as many as 4,000 stores over the next several years.             ",

To that point, since going public in June of 2023, the Mediterranean fast-casual food chain has seen its stock soar almost +100% which in this time frame has largely outperformed Starbucks -19% and the Zacks Retail-Restaurant Market’s -6% while impressively topping the broader indexes and even edging Chipotle’s +56%. Considering Cava Group has been one the hottest IPOs in recent memory let’s see if it's still time to buy CAVA for more upside. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Q1 Review Posting Q1 sales of $259.01 million, Cava Group’s top line expanded 46% over the last three months with Q4 sales at $177.17 million. This also beat Q1 sales estimates of $246.65 million by 5%. More intriguing is that Cava Group is already profitable with Q1 EPS of $0.12 crushing expectations of $0.04 per share by 200% while skyrocketing from $0.02 a share in Q4. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Growth Trajectory & Overview Although Cava Group launched its IPO last year, the company was founded in 2006 and has locations across the United States. Fueling Cava Group’s expansion is a unique dining experience with its build-your-own bowl model being similar to Chipotle as customers can customize their choice of high-quality fresh ingredients. Cava Group’s total sales are now expected to climb 24% in FY24 and are slated to jump another 20% in FY25 to just over $1 billion. Annual earnings are projected to soar 62% this year to $0.34 per share versus $0.21 a share in 2023. Plus, FY25 EPS is projected to expand another 33% to $0.46. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research More intriguing and suggestive that the rally in CAVA could continue is that earnings estimate revisions for FY24 and FY25 are nicely up in the last 30 days and have now soared over 40% in the last two months respectively. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Bottom Line Cava Group's stock currently sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) as it would be no surprise if CAVA continued to move higher considering the company’s attractive growth trajectory and the positive trend of earnings estimate revisions.

Time to Buy the Stock?","For over 50 years, restaurant chain Cracker Barrel Old Country Store (NASDAQ: CBRL) has been pleasing customers with Southern style comfort food, old-timey products in its country store, and unique antique decor throughout its locations. Weary interstate travelers stop in, relax in some front-porch rocking chairs, and perhaps even play a game of checkers. This nostalgic recipe has propelled Cracker Barrel into a well-known chain of 660 locations. But unfortunately for investors, it's worth just a small fraction of some younger, thriving restaurant chains. The Mediterranean-themed restaurant chain Cava Group (NYSE: CAVA) is a good example. As of April 21, Cava had only 323 locations -- about half the footprint of Cracker Barrel. Moreover, Cava was only just founded in 2010. In other words, Cracker Barrel had a head start of four decades to create shareholder value. But Cava is already out in front by a country mile. For evidence, we can compare the market capitalizations of both restaurant chains -- the value of the companies based on current stock market prices. Cava's market capitalization is up over $10 billion, whereas Cracker Barrel's has sunk down to a measly $1 billion. Therefore, Cava is worth 10 Cracker Barrels, in a manner of speaking. Here are some thoughts on the valuation disparity between Cracker Barrel and Cava. And, more importantly, here are some thoughts on what to do about it. Up front, understand that these business models are the same: Cracker Barrel and Cava don't franchise their restaurants -- they're all company-owned. There is a small difference in how the two companies go about it: Cava leases the real estate for all of its locations, whereas Cracker Barrel owns the real estate for about half of its restaurants. That's not the difference maker for these two companies. The biggest differentiator is the valuation for the stocks. Looking at it from a price-to-sales (P/S) valuation, Cava stock is about 37 times more expensive than Cracker Barrel stock. Why are investors willing to pay such a higher valuation for Cava? To put it simply, Cava is executing far better than Cracker Barrel. One of the most glaring differences in operations has to do with labor expenses. Cracker Barrel has already reported financial results for the first three quarters of its fiscal 2024. During this time, 36% of the company's revenue went to pay its workers. By comparison, Cava spent just under 26% of its revenue on labor -- that's a huge difference. This is just one example of Cava's superior operations. As a result, the company's restaurant-level profit margins are around 25%. Cracker Barrel has an overall operating margin of less than 3%, which is down significantly from its margin of over 10% in 2017 -- it's been a steady, multi-year decline.                ",

For investors, growth stocks can make a big difference to the performance of their portfolio and how much money they ultimately make off their investments. Currently, the stock market is hovering near all-time highs largely because of some strong performing growth stocks. These are stocks that have outperformed the broader market by a wide margin. And the companies behind them continue to flourish and expand at a rapid rate. Owning even a few of these high-flying growth equities can make all the difference when it comes to achieving wealth. Let’s explore growth stock goliaths — seven picks that will tower over the competition. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Source: Fabio Principe / Shutterstock.com The stock of audio streaming giant Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) continues to rip higher. So far this year, SPOT has gained 70%, bringing its 12 month increase to 105%. The company has distinguished itself as the dominant player in the streaming of music, podcasts and audiobooks. And, Spotify is giving satellite radio a run for its money. The latest news to drive the share price higher is that Spotify is raising the prices it charges for its premium plans in the U.S. as it tries to expand profit margins. Additionally, the Swedish company has raised prices for its monthly individual premium plan to $11.99 from $10.99. Spotify has also increased the price of its premium duo plan to $16.99 from $14.99 and hiked its family plan to $19.99 from $16.99 previously. The price increases are the latest attempt by SPOT to improve margins. The company had already lowered its spending and cut staff. Spotify’s quarterly profit topped $1 billion for the first time this April after the company curtailed its global marketing spend.

The company reported EPS of $2.14 versus $1.74 that was expected among analysts. Revenue totaled $1.02 billion compared to $963.3 million that was forecast on Wall Street. Sales were up 22% from last year and profits were nearly seven times higher than Q1 of 2023. Further, Abercrombie & Fitch said the results represented the strongest first quarter in its 132-year history. The company has been one of the best-performing retailers coming out of the pandemic. Specifically, it reported double-digit sales growth throughout 2023. Abercrombie & Fitch’s financial results have improved over the past six years when the company began to transform into a brand geared toward working millennials.                               ",

""We wanted to create something people can’t get anywhere else, that’s elevated, but also accessible to everyone.""

The fast-casual restaurant chain, which serves Mediterranean fare, has soared in value by more than 100% since it went public in June 2023, and recently set a new all-time high after reporting first-quarter earnings. It is adding locations at a rapid pace and just achieved profitability. Many investors think Cava could be the next Chipotle Mexican Grill. Should you buy the stock now? Cava runs its restaurants on a simple model similar to Chipotle's, with custom-made sandwiches, salads, and bowls, but with Mediterranean food instead of Mexican. This means pitas instead of tortillas, feta cheese instead of queso, and hummus instead of guacamole. Because there are no other large-scale chains offering that particular cuisine, Cava has found a nice niche within the restaurant space. It currently has 323 locations and is growing its brand. Traffic across stores that have remained open has grown by 17% cumulatively over the last two years. That rising traffic, combined with price increases, has allowed Cava to deliver solid same-store sales growth. Last quarter, it posted 2.3% comparable sales growth, but it achieved 28% in the prior-year quarter, adding up to strong two-year growth. Overall, this concept is resonating with consumers looking for quick and healthy Mediterranean food. Now, management plans to scale it around the country. This year, Cava expects to open 50 to 54 new locations. That's a rapid growth rate for a restaurant chain, and should lead to durable revenue growth for the next five to 10 years. Given that some other fast-casual chains have thousands of U.S. stores, it's easy to conclude that Cava has plenty of room to expand from its current count. Plus, with inflation and traffic growth, the company can still achieve more growth by increasing its revenues from its existing restaurant locations. Though it has been spending heavily on its growth efforts, Cava Group is already profitable. Last quarter, it posted $9.2 million in operating income for a margin of 3.5%. Its margins should increase as the business matures, too. It has a cash balance of $329 million, and more important, is cash-flow positive, which will make it easier for the company to self-fund its future growth efforts. It is hard to find any flaws with Cava's operations. It seems to be firing on all cylinders at the moment. But does that make the stock a buy? The market has baked some high expectations for growth into Cava's share price. The company has a market cap of $10 billion, which is more than 10 times its trailing revenues. For a restaurant chain with a low gross margin, that price-to-sales ratio is expensive compared to most other players in the space.           ",

They have more than tripled since October 2023. That momentum was bolstered by the company's latest financial results that revealed Cava beat Wall Street revenue and earnings estimates for the fiscal 2024 first quarter that ended April 21. Investors are probably wondering if this restaurant stock is worthy of a position in their portfolios. Before you rush to buy shares hand over fist, know these two facts first. Cava's main attraction for investors is that it has huge growth potential. Management wants to have 1,000 stores open by 2032, up from the current footprint of 323. This target, no matter how likely or unlikely it is to happen, can draw excitement from the market. After opening 72 net new stores last year, executives plan to open 50 to 54 this year. Of course, if a business opens new locations, sales should trend higher. And that's what we're seeing here, as Cava's revenue increased 30% in Q1 on a year-over-year basis. But investors need to dig a bit deeper to understand the unit economics. For a retail-based enterprise, same-store sales are one of the most important metrics to pay attention to. This measures the growth in revenue per location over a certain time period, usually 12 months. During the latest fiscal quarter, Cava reported same-store sales growth of 2.3%. While this was higher than what Wall Street forecasted, I think it was disappointing. For the full year, the expectation is that same-store sales will rise 5.5% (at the midpoint). That was also higher than the leadership team's previous outlook, but it's not anything to write home about. For an up-and-coming restaurant chain that supposedly has exciting long-term potential, this should give prospective investors pause. If Cava really was gaining broad consumer adoption and market share, then you'd expect same-store sales to march higher at a faster pace. The fact that it's not tells me that consumers lose interest not long after a new restaurant is opened. Chipotle, which has more than 10-times as many locations as Cava does and which was founded 13 years earlier, posted a same-store sales gain of 7% in the first three months of this year. The more mature restaurant chain is performing better. Chipotle is also dealing with the same macroeconomic headwinds that Cava is facing, like higher interest rates and inflationary pressures. Unless Cava can boost the revenue each location can generate, then investors should be skeptical of its long-term outlook.             ",

Time to Buy the Stock?","In the restaurant space, investors are constantly on the lookout for what company could become the next Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG). And for good reason -- Chipotle's stock is up over 7,000% since it IPO'd back in 2006. The latest contender is Cava Group (NYSE: CAVA), a Mediterranean restaurant fast-casual concept that has been growing its restaurant base quickly. The company reported strong revenue growth in the first quarter. Let's take a close look at Cava's most recent earnings report and see whether the stock makes good sense for investors now. Cava saw revenue for its fiscal Q1, which ended April 21, soar 30% to $256.3 million. The growth was aided by the company having 323 locations at period end versus 263 at the end of its fiscal Q1 a year ago. Same restaurant sales grew 2.3%, although the company said that adjusting for holiday shifts, it would have seen 4.3% growth. Cava saw a 3.5% benefit from menu price increases and mix, while guest traffic was down -1.2%. Notably, the company was facing difficult comparisons, as a year ago it saw same restaurant sales growth of 28.4%. Its restaurant level margins (RLM) ticked down slightly to 25.2% from 25.4%. This metric helps measure the profitability of its restaurants before corporate costs. Food costs as a percentage of revenue went down, but labor costs rose. The company flipped to a profit, with earnings per share of $0.12 versus a loss of $1.30 a year earlier. Adjusted EBITDA, meanwhile, nearly doubled to $33.3 million. Cava also generated $38.4 million in operating cash flow on the quarter and free cash flow of $4.7 million. This is important, as it shows the company can self-fund its restaurant expansion plans, which is one of the long-term key drivers for the stock. As a result of its solid start to the year, Cava also raised its full-year guidance. It now expects same restaurant sales growth to come in between 4.5% to 6.5%, from an earlier range of 3% to 5%, and for adjusted EBITDA of between $100 million to $105 million, up from a prior outlook of $86 million to $92 million. Cava also increased its expected restaurant openings for this fiscal year to between 50 to 54, up from an earlier view of 48 to 52 new locations. The company said it does see a potential traffic headwind as the excitement that came with its IPO last year starts to fade. However, it is expecting the launch of a new grilled steak offering to help boost comps, given the favorable reception the dish has had in test markets in Boston and Dallas. Cava will also look to roll out a loyalty program by year-end, although its potential positive effect is not contemplated in its current guidance. The steak rollout will, however, be a slight headwind to its restaurant level margins.            ",

While the stock has been a strong performer lately, this trend might continue since analysts are still raising their earnings estimates for the company. Analysts' growing optimism on the earnings prospects of this Mediterranean restaurant chain is driving estimates higher, which should get reflected in its stock price. After all, empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.

Just Beat EPS By 198%: Here's What Analysts Think Will Happen Next","As you might know, CAVA Group, Inc. (NYSE:CAVA) just kicked off its latest quarterly results with some very strong numbers. The company beat forecasts, with revenue of US$259m, some 5.5% above estimates, and statutory earnings per share (EPS) coming in at US$0.12, 198% ahead of expectations. Following the result, the analysts have updated their earnings model, and it would be good to know whether they think there's been a strong change in the company's prospects, or if it's business as usual. We've gathered the most recent statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their earnings models, following these results. Check out our latest analysis for CAVA Group Following the latest results, CAVA Group's nine analysts are now forecasting revenues of US$897.9m in 2024. This would be a solid 14% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to surge 33% to US$0.34. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$874.7m and earnings per share (EPS) of US$0.25 in 2024. So it seems there's been a definite increase in optimism about CAVA Group's future following the latest results, with a considerable lift to the earnings per share forecasts in particular. It will come as no surprise to learn that the analysts have increased their price target for CAVA Group 27% to US$86.20on the back of these upgrades. It could also be instructive to look at the range of analyst estimates, to evaluate how different the outlier opinions are from the mean. There are some variant perceptions on CAVA Group, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$94.00 and the most bearish at US$72.00 per share. With such a narrow range of valuations, the analysts apparently share similar views on what they think the business is worth. One way to get more context on these forecasts is to look at how they compare to both past performance, and how other companies in the same industry are performing. We would highlight that CAVA Group's revenue growth is expected to slow, with the forecast 20% annualised growth rate until the end of 2024 being well below the historical 29% growth over the last year. Juxtapose this against the other companies in the industry with analyst coverage, which are forecast to grow their revenues (in aggregate) 9.8% per year. Even after the forecast slowdown in growth, it seems obvious that CAVA Group is also expected to grow faster than the wider industry. The most important thing here is that the analysts upgraded their earnings per share estimates, suggesting that there has been a clear increase in optimism towards CAVA Group following these results. Happily, they also upgraded their revenue estimates, and are forecasting them to grow faster than the wider industry. We note an upgrade to the price target, suggesting that the analysts believes the intrinsic value of the business is likely to improve over time.   ",

Many great companies have stocks that are on sale right now and ripe for the picking. This is especially true of share prices that are down despite companies posting strong financial results and either maintaining or raising their forward guidance. Despite strong results and a bullish outlook, some stocks are down because of macro-economic conditions beyond their control. But that’s what makes them great low-priced breakout stocks. A pullback in consumer discretionary spending due to persistent inflation and high interest rates has been a running theme through first-quarter earnings season. This has led to selloffs in some truly outstanding companies. Stocks that have consistently beaten the market over the long-term are now down and their share price looks cheap. This presents an opportunity for shrewd investors to take advantage of before the stocks inevitably rise again. Here are three currently low-priced stocks poised for a breakout. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Source: Nicole Glass Photography / Shutterstock.com Investors would be smart to buy the dip in Cava Group (NYSE:CAVA) after the Mediterranean restaurant chain reported blowout first-quarter financial results that crushed Wall Street forecasts. The company reported earnings per share (EPS) of 12 cents, which was more than double the 5 cents expected among analysts. Revenue totaled $256.3 million, ahead of expectations for $246 million. Sales were up 30% from a year ago. Cava opened 14 new restaurant locations during the quarter, bringing its national count to 323 outlets. Despite the strong print, CAVA stock fell 5% after the company said that its same-store sales increased only 2.3% from a year ago as consumers spend less on dining out. In the previous quarter, Cava’s same-store sales grew 11% year-over-year (YOY). The pullback among consumers is likely to be temporary and doesn’t take away from the company’s long-term growth potential. Cava has now reported four consecutive quarters of profitability since going public in June 2023. The company raised its forward guidance for the current year, saying it expects to add 50 to 54 new restaurant locations and see same-store sales growth between 4.5% and 6.5%. Cava is also forecasting full-year earnings of $100 million to $105 million. That’s an increase from an earlier forecast of $86 million to $92 million. Since going public nearly a year ago, CAVA stock has risen 143%.              ",

Chipotle has given its owners great returns over the past five years, with the stock up by nearly 360%. Investors are increasingly paying attention to another stock in the industry, Cava Group Inc (NYSE:CAVA), a much smaller chain. Focused on Mediterranean cuisine, Cava’s stock has increased by 112% year to date. This momentum raises the question of whether Cava offers a unique investing opportunity. Like Chipotle’s, Cava’s business concept lets patrons create salads, grain bowls, or pitas. Management credits growing public awareness of better dietary options as a driver of success, while Cava’s fast-casual style improves accessibility and convenience for its customers. Amid inflation and economic uncertainty, Cava has shown great growth. Its sales increased by 59.8% in 2023, thanks to 72 new stores opening and 17.9% more sales at existing stores. Last year, the company made $729 million in sales, 518% more than the previous year. High-growth businesses often lose money, but Cava generated a net income of $13.3 million last year after losing $59 million the year before. The chain reported 309 stores on Dec. 31, 2023, and the leadership team has ambitions to scale to 1,000 outlets throughout the United States by 2032. Trending: Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are bullish on one city that could dethrone New York and become the new financial capital of the US. Investing in its booming real estate market has never been more accessible. Investors hope that Cava can replicate Chipotle’s long-term success. With 3,500 locations, Chipotle continues to expand rapidly, opening 271 new stores last year. Its strong revenue and earnings growth have made its shares attractive to investors. Expectations for Cava are high, with its stock trading at a price-to-sales ratio of 11.1, a 30 percent premium over Chipotle. However, this high valuation raises questions about its justification. Cava’s valuation suggests management will achieve its goal of opening 1,000 stores ahead of the 2032 target. The company plans to open 50 net new sites in 2024, a decrease from the previous year. Also, same-store sales are only expected to rise by 3% to 5%, which is very different from last year’s growth of 10% or more. Chipotle expects similar sales growth in the mid-to-high-single-digit range this year, even though it is larger and has a greater percentage of the U.S. market.     ",

As we delve into a SWOT analysis of Cava Group Inc, we aim to provide investors with a deeper understanding of the company's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats, informed by the latest financial data and market trends. Revenue Growth and Profitability: Cava Group Inc has demonstrated a strong financial performance, with a notable increase in revenue and a shift from a net loss to a net profit. This growth is a testament to the company's effective business model and operational excellence. The increase in revenue by over 27% from the same period last year, coupled with a net income of nearly $14 million, reflects the company's ability to scale successfully while maintaining profitability. Brand and Menu Appeal: CAVA's focus on Mediterranean cuisine, known for its health benefits, positions the brand favorably in the fast-casual dining market. The company's ability to offer bold and satisfying flavors while promoting a healthful lifestyle resonates with the growing consumer demand for healthier dining options. This strength is reflected in the company's CAVA AUV (Average Unit Volume) and Same Restaurant Sales Growth, indicating strong brand loyalty and customer retention. Operating Expense Management: Despite the revenue growth, Cava Group Inc's operating expenses have also increased, particularly in areas such as labor, occupancy, and other operating expenses. The company must continue to manage these costs effectively to maintain its profitability. The increase in labor costs, partly due to higher average hourly wages, highlights the need for ongoing efficiency improvements and cost control measures.        ",

(NYSE: CAVA) (""CAVA Group"" or the ""Company""), the category-defining Mediterranean fast-casual restaurant brand that brings heart, health, and humanity to food, today announced financial results for its fiscal first quarter ended April 21, 2024. ""CAVA’s results in the first quarter demonstrate the strength of our category-defining brand, our clear leadership position in Mediterranean and our compelling differentiated value proposition,"" said Brett Schulman, Co-Founder and CEO. ""Driven by our highly portable Mediterranean concept and powerful unit economic engine, we generated our fourth consecutive quarter of net income and our first quarter ever of positive free cash flow. During the quarter, Same Restaurant Sales grew 2.3%, an exceptional 30.7% on a 2-year basis. We opened 14 net new restaurants and as we continue to invest in scalable infrastructure to support our growth, we are in a strong position to capture the significant whitespace opportunity ahead of us."" Fiscal First Quarter 2024 Highlights: CAVA Revenue grew 30.3% to $256.3 million as compared to $196.8 million in the prior year quarter. Net New CAVA Restaurant Openings of 14, bringing total CAVA Restaurants to 323, a 22.8% increase in total CAVA Restaurants year over year. CAVA Same Restaurant Sales Growth of 2.3%. CAVA AUV of $2.6 million as compared to $2.5 million in the prior year quarter. CAVA Restaurant-Level Profit of $64.6 million or growth of 29.3% over the prior year quarter, with CAVA Restaurant-Level Profit Margin of 25.2%. CAVA Digital Revenue Mix was 37.0%. CAVA Group Net Income of $14.0 million compared to net loss of $2.1 million in the prior year quarter. CAVA Group Adjusted EBITDA(1) of $33.3 million compared to $16.7 million in the prior year quarter. Net cash provided by operating activities of $38.4 million with Free Cash Flow(1) of $4.7 million. CAVA Fiscal First Quarter 2024 Review: CAVA Revenue was $256.3 million, an increase of 30.3% compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2023. The increase was primarily driven by 86 Net New CAVA Restaurant Openings during or subsequent to the first quarter of fiscal 2023, which are exceeding our performance expectations, and CAVA Same Restaurant Sales Growth of 2.3%. CAVA Same Restaurant Sales Growth consists of a 3.5% increase from menu price and product mix, partially offset by a 1.2% decrease from guest traffic. To achieve an optimal comparison of fiscal weeks in the CAVA Same Restaurant Sales calculation giving consideration to holiday periods, each week of fiscal 2023 was shifted by one week. As a result of this shift, approximately $3.9 million of revenue is not included in CAVA Same Restaurant Sales Growth. Had this shift not been made, CAVA Same Restaurant Sales Growth would have been 4.3%. CAVA Restaurant-Level Profit Margin was 25.2% compared with 25.4% in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. The slight decrease was due to incremental wage investments, partially offset by lower food, beverage, and packaging costs as a percentage of revenue, which was driven by higher sales and lower input costs. CAVA Group Fiscal First Quarter 2024 Review: General and administrative expenses were $33.8 million, or 13.1% of revenue, as compared to $29.0 million, or 14.3% of revenue, in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. General and administrative expenses, excluding equity-based compensation(1), were $28.7 million, or 11.1% of revenue, as compared to $27.8 million, or 13.7% of revenue, in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. The decrease of 260 basis points was primarily due to higher performance-based incentive compensation in the prior year quarter and leverage from higher sales, partially offset by investments in our Collaboration Center Organization to support our growth and recurring public company costs. Net income was $14.0 million, or 5.4% of revenue, an increase of $16.1 million as compared to a net loss of $2.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Adjusted EBITDA(1) was $33.3 million, or 12.9% of revenue, an increase of $16.6 million, or 99.0%, compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2023. The increase was primarily driven by the number and strength of performance of Net New CAVA Restaurant Openings during or subsequent to the first quarter of fiscal 2023, as well as leverage in general and administrative expenses and 2.3% CAVA Same Restaurant Sales Growth. __________________ (1) General and administrative expenses, excluding equity-based compensation, Adjusted EBITDA, and Free Cash Flow are non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP are set forth in the tables at the end of this press release. Fiscal Full-Year 2024 Outlook: CAVA Group announced today that it has raised fiscal full-year 2024 guidance, as follows:   February 26, 2024  May 28, 2024 Net New CAVA Restaurant Openings  48 to 52  50 to 54 CAVA Same Restaurant Sales Growth  3.0% to 5.0%  4.5% to 6.5% CAVA Restaurant-Level Profit Margin  22.7% to 23.3%  23.7% to 24.3% Pre-opening costs  $11.5 to $12.5 million  $12.0 to $13.0 million Adjusted EBITDA  $86.0 to $92.0 million  $100.0 to $105.0 million Actual results may differ materially from CAVA Group's fiscal full-year 2024 guidance as a result of, among other things, the factors described under ""Forward-Looking Statements"" below. A reconciliation of the forward-looking fiscal 2024 Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss) cannot be provided without unreasonable effort because of the inherent difficulty of accurately forecasting the occurrence and financial impact of the various adjusting items necessary for such reconciliation that have not yet occurred, are out of our control, or cannot be reasonably predicted. About CAVA Group: CAVA is the category-defining Mediterranean fast-casual restaurant brand, bringing together healthful food and bold, satisfying flavors at scale. Our brand and our opportunity transcend the Mediterranean category to compete in the large and growing limited-service restaurant sector as well as the health and wellness food category. CAVA serves guests across gender lines, age groups, and income levels and benefits from generational tailwinds created by consumer demand for healthy living and a demographic shift towards greater ethnic diversity. We meet consumers’ desires to engage with convenient, authentic, purpose-driven brands that view food as a source of self-expression. The broad appeal of our food combined with these favorable industry trends drive our vast opportunity for continued growth.

Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements: This press release contains forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that reflect our current views with respect to, among other things, our operations and financial performance. Forward-looking statements include all statements that are not historical facts. These forward-looking statements relate to matters such as our industry, business strategy, goals, and expectations concerning our market position, future operations, margins, profitability, capital expenditures, liquidity and capital resources, and other financial and operating information. These statements may include words such as ""anticipate,"" ""assume,"" ""believe,"" ""continue,"" ""could,"" ""estimate,"" ""expect,"" ""intend,"" ""may,"" ""plan,"" ""potential,"" ""predict,"" ""project,"" ""future,"" ""will,"" ""seek,"" ""foreseeable,"" ""outlook,"" the negative version of these words or similar terms and phrases to identify forward-looking statements in this press release. The forward-looking statements contained in this press release are based on management’s current expectations and are not guarantees of future performance. The forward-looking statements are subject to various risks, uncertainties, assumptions, or changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict or quantify. Our expectations, beliefs, and projections are expressed in good faith, and we believe there is a reasonable basis for them. However, there can be no assurance that management’s expectations, beliefs, and projections will result or be achieved. Actual results may differ materially from these expectations due to changes in global, regional, or local economic, business, competitive, market, regulatory, and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. We believe that these factors include but are not limited to the following: our operation in a highly competitive industry; our ability to open new restaurants while managing our growth effectively and maintaining our culture; our ability to successfully identify appropriate locations and develop and expand our operations in existing and new markets; the profitability of new restaurants, and any impact to sales at our existing locations; the impact of changes in guest perception of our brand; our ability to successfully market our restaurants and brand; the impact of food safety, health department regulations, and food-borne illness concerns together with our ability to adequately address such concerns and meet regulatory obligations, including at our manufacturing facilities; our ability to maintain or increase prices; our ability to accurately predict guest trends and demand and successfully introduce new menu offerings and improve our existing menu offerings; the risks associated with leasing property; our ability to successfully expand our digital and delivery business; our ability to utilize, recognize, respond to, and effectively manage the immediacy of social media; our ability to achieve or maintain profitability in the future, especially if we continue to grow at an accelerated rate; our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from past and potential future acquisitions, investments or other strategic initiatives; our ability to manage our manufacturing and supply chain effectively; the impact of shortages, delays, or interruptions in the delivery of food items and other products; our ability to successfully optimize, operate, and manage our production facilities; the risks associated with our reliance on third parties; the impact of increases in food, commodity, energy, and other costs; the impact of increases in labor costs, labor shortages, and our ability to identify, hire, train, motivate and retain the right team members; our ability to attract, develop, and retain our management team and key team members; the impact of any cybersecurity breaches and our ability to respond effectively to technology threats or events; the impact of failures, or interruptions in, or our inability to effectively scale and adapt, our information technology systems; our ability to comply with, or changes in, the extensive laws or regulations requirements to which we are subject, including those related to privacy; the impact of economic factors and guest behavior trends; the impact of evolving rules and regulations with respect to environmental, social and governance matters; risks associated with our ability to secure, and protect our intellectual property; risks associated with civil unrest, acts of terrorism, threats to national security, the conflicts in Eastern Europe and the Middle East and other geopolitical events, including potential discriminatory perspectives towards certain cuisines; the impact of climate change and volatile adverse weather conditions; and each of the other factors set forth in ""Part I—Item 1A. Risk Factors"" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, and in other reports filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, all of which are available on the investor relations page of our website at investor.cava.com. The forward-looking statements included in this press release are made only as of the date hereof. Any forward-looking statement made by us in this press release speaks only as of the date of this press release and are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements included in this press release. Factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. Non-GAAP Financial Measures: In addition to our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with GAAP, we present Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, general and administrative expenses, excluding equity-based compensation, and Free Cash Flow in this press release as supplemental measures of financial performance that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe they assist investors and analysts in comparing our operating performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our operating performance. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, general and administrative expenses, excluding equity-based compensation, and Free Cash Flow are useful to investors in highlighting trends in our operating performance, while other measures can differ significantly depending on long-term strategic decisions regarding capital structure, the tax jurisdictions in which we operate, and capital investments. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, general and administrative expenses, excluding equity-based compensation, and Free Cash Flow to supplement GAAP measures of performance in the evaluation of the effectiveness of our business strategies, to make budgeting decisions, and to compare our performance against that of other peer companies using similar measures. Management supplements GAAP results with non-GAAP financial measures to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the business than GAAP results alone provide. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, general and administrative expenses, excluding equity-based compensation, and Free Cash Flow are not recognized terms under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss), net income (loss) margin, or general and administrative expenses, as applicable, as measures of financial performance or cash provided by operating activities as measures of liquidity, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow are not intended to be measures of free cash flow available for management’s discretionary use, as Adjusted EBITDA does not consider certain cash requirements such as interest payments, tax payments, and financing cash flows, and Free Cash Flow does not consider certain cash requirements such as financing cash flows. Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to invest in the business growth or to reduce indebtedness. Our non-GAAP measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation, or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest payments, and Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow do not reflect cash flows from financing activities of our business; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect period to period changes in taxes, income tax expense, or the cash necessary to pay income taxes; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the impact of earnings or cash charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations; although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, general and administrative expenses, excluding equity-based compensation, and Free Cash Flow differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.

The Nasdaq-100 continues to make new all-time highs seemingly almost every week. Every dip, no matter how brief, is instantly bought up as traders pile in to profit from further bullish momentum. But trees don’t grow to the sky. At some point, the rally will end. And with the Nasdaq up more than 70% from the 2022 lows, valuations are becoming increasingly untethered from these companies’ underlying fundamentals. As metrics such as price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-sales (P/S) head to ever-loftier heights for leading growth stocks, traders should be taking a wary look toward the exits. At some point the momentum will reverse, and the ensuing selling could be swift. These are seven especially risky growth stocks to sell now while prices are still favorable. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Source: Diego Thomazini / Shutterstock.com Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) is the worldwide leader in streaming music. While streaming audio is a highly competitive market in North America, in emerging markets such as Latin America, Spotify has taken a dominant position in music streaming. This led many investors, myself included, to think that Spotify could exhibit monopoly-like characteristics. In turn, this would allow Spotify to raise prices, hammer out better contracts with the record labels and greatly improve profit margins. I was a longtime investor in SPOT stock, but I sold my position and am now bearish simply because that thesis didn’t play out whatsoever. Specifically, in 2018, Spotify generated a gross profit margin of 25.7%. In 2023, its gross profit margin fell to 25.6%. Despite adding hundreds of millions of users, investing heavily in content like podcasts and building its brand dramatically, Spotify wasn’t able to use that to improve the business’ economics whatsoever. That is reflected on the bottom line as well. Spotify generated a net loss of $89 million in 2018. This ballooned to a loss of $580 million in 2023. The company has yet to generate a GAAP profit on a full-year basis. While Spotify stock has more than doubled over the past year, its underlying business economics are as fuzzy as ever. Source: dennizn / Shutterstock Duolingo (NASDAQ:DUOL) shares sold off sharply following a recent downbeat earnings report. Despite that, however, DUOL stock is still up dramatically in the bigger picture with shares rallying approximately 150% since the start of 2023. There’s no doubt that Duolingo has brought a fresh and innovative approach to the language-learning arena. I live abroad and have met many fellow expats that have had positive experiences with Duolingo to help jumpstart their studies. That said, a good app isn’t necessarily a great business.                                    ",

Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important? Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Cava Group (CAVA) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage. Cava currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.61, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 14 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.61 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy. Of the 14 recommendations that derive the current ABR, nine are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 64.3% and 7.1% of all recommendations. Brokerage Recommendation Trends for CAVA Check price target & stock forecast for Cava here>>>

While the ABR calls for buying Cava, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential. Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations. This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements. With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision. Zacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR Although both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether. The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.             ",

CAVA is scheduled to report fiscal first-quarter 2024 results on May 28. In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 100%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal first-quarter 2024 earnings per share has remained stable at 3 cents over the past 30 days. In the last quarter, the company reported earnings per share of 2 cents.

The consensus mark for total revenues is pegged at $245.9 million, suggesting a sequential gain of 38.9% from the reported figure of $177 million. The company’s results are likely to be aided by menu price increases and a favorable product mix. These positive factors are likely to have driven CAVA restaurant’s sales growth. Additionally, new restaurant openings are expected to have supported growth.

The company's emphasis on category-defining brands and highly differentiated product offerings has bolstered growth prospects to some extent. A sequential improvement in visitation is likely to have driven the top line. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CAVA Group restaurant sales is pegged at $243 million, up 38.9% sequentially.

However, increases in food, beverage and packaging expenses, along with labor inflation due to higher average hourly wages, are likely to have negatively impacted the company’s bottom line. Commodity inflation is also likely to have been an overhang. CAVA Group, Inc. price-eps-surprise | CAVA Group, Inc.

Per our proven model, a stock with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates. This is not the case here.

The Tex-Mex fast casual concept is still expanding rapidly, while posting incredible profitability. It makes sense that investors seeking the next big industry winner are now taking a closer look at Cava (NYSE: CAVA), a much smaller chain. This surging restaurant stock is already up nearly 90% year to date. Does this powerful momentum make Cava a once-in-a-generation investment opportunity? Cava focuses on Mediterranean food, using a similar model to Chipotle that allows hungry patrons to build their own salads, grain bowls, or pitas. Clearly, this is catching on with consumers. Management points to a growing interest from the general public in making healthy food choices as a key tailwind, and Cava's fast-casual approach only increases accessibility and convenience for its customers. Despite inflationary pressures and general economic uncertainty, Cava continues to put up strong growth figures. In 2023, revenue jumped 59.8%, boosted by 72 new store openings and a 17.9% same-store sales growth. Last year's sales figure of $729 million was 518% higher than five years ago in 2018. Businesses that are investing aggressively in growth initiatives typically aren't profitable, so it might be surprising to learn that Cava bucks this trend. It registered $13.3 million in net income last year after posting a $59 million net loss in 2022. The hope for shareholders is that consistent and rising earnings will become the norm. By 2032, the executive team believes it can have 1,000 locations open across the U.S., up from 309 (as of Dec. 31, 2023). This growth potential is probably what investors are most excited about. It should come as no surprise that investors hope Cava can mirror the long-term success of Chipotle. Even with 3,500 existing locations, the fast-casual leader is expanding at a blistering pace with 271 store openings last year. Shares have been a huge winner for investors, thanks to the strong revenue and earnings growth that show no signs of slowing down. The resulting expectations for Cava are high, and the stock trades at a price-to-sales ratio of 11.1, a 30% premium to Chipotle. I'm not sure if this steep multiple is warranted. Cava's valuation implies that management's long-term target of opening 1,000 stores is a virtual certainty, perhaps at an even faster pace than the leadership team's 2032 deadline. But I'm not as confident. Growth is already forecast to slow dramatically. The company plans to open 50 net new locations (at the midpoint of guidance) in 2024, a meaningful drop from last year. Even worse, same-store sales are only set to rise 3% to 5%, an extremely disappointing outlook given the company's double-digit growth last year. For comparison's sake, Chipotle is projecting mid- to high-single-digit comparable-sales growth this year, even though it's already a much bigger enterprise that's further penetrated in the U.S.          ",

Notably, several Zacks Retail-Restaurants stocks have hit 52-week highs this spring and could have more upside ahead. To that point, the trend of upward earnings estimate revisions suggests the blazing price performances of these retail-restaurant stocks could continue going into the summer. This has contributed to their buy ratings and these restaurants are seeing expansive growth on their top and bottom lines. With now looking like an ideal time to invest here are three of these top-rated retail-restaurant stocks to consider. Brinker International EAT Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) Outside of its steady growth, Brinker International’s stock is still attractive in terms of valuation despite soaring +48% year to date and currently trading at a 52-week high of $64 a share. Still, the operator of Chili’s Grill & Bar and Maggiano’s Little Italy trades at a 15.9X forward earnings multiple which is a pleasant discount to the industry average of 24.1X and the S&P 500’s 22.2X. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Amid this year’s rally, rising earnings estimates have kept Brinker International’s P/E valuation reasonable. In this regard, fiscal 2024 and FY25 EPS estimates have spiked 6% in the last 30 days respectively. Brinker International's annual earnings are now expected to climb 39% this year to $3.94 per share compared to $2.83 a share in 2023. Another 11% EPS growth is in the forecast for FY25. Plus, total sales are projected to rise 5% in FY24 and are slated to increase another 3% next year to $4.47 billion. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Wingstop WING Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) Also boasting a strong buy rating, earnings estimates are noticeably higher for Wingstop in the last month with FY24 and FY25 EPS estimates now up 13% over the last 60 days. It’s noteworthy that Wingstop has an “A” Zacks Style Scores grade for Growth as annual earnings are forecasted to climb 36% in FY24 and are projected to soar another 22% in FY25 to $4.14 per share. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research More impressive, Wingstop’s total sales are projected to soar 27% this year with the company’s top line expected to expand another 17% in FY25 to $685.82 million.

The fast-casual restaurant chain has posted phenomenal returns for investors after taking its healthy Mexican fare across the U.S. The company currently has a market capitalization of $86 billion, making it one of the largest restaurant brands in the world. The success of Chipotle has spawned a lot of fast-casual restaurant copycats. One of the most successful is Cava Group (NYSE: CAVA), which has a similar concept to Chipotle but with Mediterranean food. It is growing its restaurant count like gangbusters and went public through an initial public offering (IPO) less than a year ago. Should you buy Cava stock for your portfolio right now? Cava does build-your-own grain bowls and sandwich wraps in a similar fashion to Chipotle. But instead of Mexican food, it does Mediterranean wraps with falafel, hummus, and pita bread. In 2023, Cava locations did $2.6 million in average unit volumes (AUVs) with 24.8% restaurant-level profit margins. This novel concept seems to be resonating with customers, as foot traffic per store increased 10% year over year in 2023. At the end of 2023, Cava had 309 restaurant units. Last year, it generated $717.1 million in revenue, up an astonishing 60% from 2022. The company is expanding rapidly with this restaurant concept, and doing so while still generating a profit. Cava Group net income was $13.9 million in 2023. It is rare to find a company growing this quickly that is also profitable, which is a great sign for investors. In its IPO documents, management said it thinks there is room for at least 1,000 Cava restaurant locations in the United States. Last year, it opened 72 stores, and it plans to open 50 more in 2024. If the company opens 50 restaurants each year, it will hit around 1,000 units 14 years from now. This gives the company a long runway to reinvest for growth, which is important for growth stock investors to consider. Assuming AUVs can expand to $3 million -- a conservative estimate if you think inflation is even slightly positive -- 1,000 units should equate to $3 billion in annual sales from Cava restaurants. That would be more than 4x its 2023 sales levels, even with conservative AUV assumptions. The company began on the East Coast of the United States and now has toeholds in places like California and Colorado. With comparable sales still strong at 11.4% in the fourth quarter of 2023, it looks like Cava's fast-casual concept is resonating around the country. This should indicate to investors that Cava can reinvest in new markets like Colorado and California with strong returns to drive revenue and earnings higher for years to come.            ",

Meanwhile, stocks in the Retail-Wholesale group have gained about 10.8% on average. This means that Cava Group is performing better than its sector in terms of year-to-date returns. Another Retail-Wholesale stock, which has outperformed the sector so far this year, is Sprouts Farmers (SFM). The stock has returned 59.7% year-to-date. Over the past three months, Sprouts Farmers' consensus EPS estimate for the current year has increased 10%. The stock currently has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). To break things down more, Cava Group belongs to the Retail - Restaurants industry, a group that includes 42 individual companies and currently sits at #157 in the Zacks Industry Rank.

Target's Earnings ESP sits at 6.39%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $2.18 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.05. TGT is just one of a large group of Retail-Wholesale stocks with a positive ESP figure. Cava Group (CAVA) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider. Cava Group, which is readying to report earnings on May 28, 2024, sits at a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $0.06 a share, and CAVA is 13 days out from its next earnings report. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Cava Group is $0.03, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 133.34%. TGT and CAVA's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.

As part of its ongoing work to build a scalable infrastructure to support its growth, the company made an initial investment of approximately $35 million in the facility, which manufactures CAVA’s proprietary dips and spreads, including tzatziki, harissa, and Crazy Feta®, as well as select dressings. Along with an existing facility in Laurel, Maryland, the Verona operation can support at least 750 restaurants and the expansion of CAVA’s consumer packaged goods business. ""CAVA Foods Verona is part of a vertically integrated model that supports our business now and over the long term. By centrally producing our dips and spreads, we reduce complexity in our restaurants, improve costs overall, and maintain the quality, consistency, and integrity of our chef-crafted recipes at scale,"" said Brett Schulman, Co-Founder and CEO.

It has been compared to the restaurant mega-chain Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG) for its healthy fast-casual food and prices. But is that a fair comparison? And stacked up against each other, which stock is the better buy today? Cava is a small but fast-growing chain operating throughout the U.S. It had 309 restaurants as of the end of 2023, with plans to enter new markets and open another 50 in 2024. What's exciting about Cava is that if its concept is catching on, it can turn into a powerhouse chain like Chipotle. And considering the latter's success, that's a premise investors would find awfully attractive. Here's the chance to get in early and reap the gain of owning a huge-opportunity stock. Chipotle has gained more than 500% over the past 10 years, and who wouldn't want to get in on that? Cava is demonstrating high sales growth, which isn't surprising for a young company expanding quickly. Revenue increased 60% year over year in 2023. What's more surprising is its strong growth in comparable-restaurant sales (comps) and profitability. Comps increased 18% year over year in 2023, and net income was $13.3 million after a $59 million loss last year. If Cava can keep that up, it can continue to grow quickly and create tremendous shareholder value. Chipotle churns out revenue and profit increases regularly. Customers love its fresh food at mid-range prices, and it's been reporting superb performance despite the inflationary environment. Revenue increased 14% year over year in the 2024 first quarter, with a 7% increase in comps. Its operating margin expanded from 15.5% last year to 16.3%, and earnings per share (EPS) rose from $10.50 in the 2023 first quarter to $13.01. It opened 47 new stores for a total of nearly 3,500, and it sees the opportunity to double that total in North America. About 300 stores are targeted to open in 2024. In more recent news, management said that it's closing Farmesa, the salad and bowl concept it opened last year. It had only one location. It's not the first time Chipotle has closed a new brand concept. It has ended several other ones, such as Shophouse Asian Kitchen in 2017. In other words, it's not an easy concept to replicate. Chipotle is known to be an expensive stock. It pretty much always trades at a premium valuation because it's so reliable for growth. Cava, though, is incredibly expensive, even compared with Chipotle.           ",

(NYSE:CAVA) served up strong growth last year, investors are hoping for a second course in 2024. Shares of the fast-casual chain hit a fresh record high of $77.14 on Monday, less than a year after opening at an IPO price of $42.00. The mid-cap high-flier is up more than 70% year-to-date and is showing no sign of slowing down. CAVA Group is an up-and-coming restaurant operator that is based in Washington, D.C. Boldly going head-to-head with Chipotle (NYSE:CMG), it offers a variety of heart-healthy Mediterranean bowls and pitas at locations across the United States. CAVA Group stock is currently on an impressive seven-month win streak on the backs of some strong 2023 financials. In a tough discretionary spending environment, the company grew revenue and same-restaurant sales by 60% and 18%, respectively, last year. It is not only growing by expanding its footprint but also by generating higher sales at existing locations. In addition to producing strong top-line growth, CAVA Group is already profitable. The company has recorded profits in each of the first three quarters since going public in June 2023. It is also three-for-three in surpassing Wall Street’s earnings estimates. I am optimistic about CAVA Group’s potential to replicate its above-industry growth, going forward. The restaurant chain has created a niche category within the fast-growing limited-service restaurant space. Its food matches consumers’ increasing demand for healthy protein, vegetables, and fruits as part of broader U.S. health and wellness trends. By the second half of this year, CAVA Group plans to have steak on the menu at all locations. CAVA Group is poised to build off its recent success by staying in tune with customer preferences and opening many new stores. In 2023, CAVA Group opened 72 new restaurants, a 30% increase from 2022. This was a gutsy move, considering inflation and elevated credit card rates had big impacts on American discretionary budgets. The company is doubling down on its aggressive expansion strategy. It expects to build 48 to 52 more restaurants this year to bring its total unit count to at least 357. This may only be the beginning. CAVA Group ended 2023 with 309 restaurants across 24 U.S. states. Management believes the company is in the early stages of expansion and has the potential to top 1,000 locations by 2032. The company generally targets upper-middle-income households in highly populated urban and suburban settings. Catering to higher-earning consumers definitely played a role in last year’s outperformance, and this makes CAVA Group a relatively economy-proof restaurant stock.        ",

Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings. Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises. 2 Stocks to Add to Your Watchlist The Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure. The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Cava Group (CAVA) earns a Zacks Rank #2 27 days from its next quarterly earnings release on May 27, 2024, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $0.04 a share. By taking the percentage difference between the $0.04 Most Accurate Estimate and the $0.03 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Cava Group has an Earnings ESP of 55.56%. CAVA is part of a big group of Retail-Wholesale stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at AutoZone (AZO) as well. Slated to report earnings on May 28, 2024, AutoZone holds a #2 (Buy) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $35.85 a share 28 days from its next quarterly update.

The company essentially pioneered the modern-day coffeehouse concept in the 1990's and the format has been copied by a wide range of competitors, including independent coffee shops and large chains. Howard Schultz's fundamental innovation, bringing espresso drinks to the American market and adapting the experience to American tastes, generated tens of billions of dollar market value for Starbucks and made the brand famous around the world. However, these days Starbucks appears to be struggling. The stock has underperformed the S&P 500 over the last few years, comparable sales growth has been sluggish, and Starbucks' reputation has suffered due to a unionization push that has led to some stores closing. Investors looking for the kind of growth that Starbucks represented in its earlier years are better off looking elsewhere. And one top restaurant stock to consider is Cava Group (NYSE: CAVA). Cava has been a publicly traded stock for less than a year, but it's showing the strength of a much more mature restaurant company. The company combines strong comparable sales, an aggressive expansion strategy, improving restaurant-level operating margins, and a proven business model. Cava is a Mediterranean fast-casual chain and resembles Chipotle in a number of ways. Like Chipotle, Cava's menu is focused around rolled-up pita sandwiches that resemble burritos as well as bowls. The fast-casual chain is also well-represented in the digital channel as digital orders made up 36% of its revenue last year. Its other results help show Cava's potential. Revenue jumped 60% last year to $717.1 million as it opened 72 locations. The company now operates more than 300 restaurants, benefiting from its acquisition and rebranding of Zoe's Kitchen. Comparable sales last year surged 18%, and the company recorded average unit volumes of $2.6 million, showing its restaurants bring in high volumes of customers, a bullish sign for the company's future growth. On the bottom line, Cava's growth story is also taking shape. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) of $73.6 margin compared to $12.6 million in the quarter. Restaurant-level operating profit nearly expanded 450 basis points to 24.8%. The restaurant industry is competitive but it isn't complicated. Companies with profitable, popular business models like Starbucks and Chipotle tend to do well, and Cava has the makings of another industry star, as it has a lot of room to add restaurants and its brand seems to be resonating with consumers.

That's basically what's going on today with Cava Group (NYSE: CAVA), a Mediterranean fast-casual restaurant that's drawing in customers in huge numbers. The next three years are likely to see the company grow at a rapid clip. But investors need to go in with their eyes wide open, and keenly focused on this key industry metric. Cava's restaurant concept isn't really new. It basically rips off Chipotle Mexican Grill's (NYSE: CMG) assembly line approach to food preparation, but it does it with Mediterranean food instead of Mexican fare. However, this fact makes the comparison here pretty obvious. To lay some important groundwork, at the end of 2023 Chipotle had 3,371 locations in the United States (and another 66 foreign locations). Cava's store count at the end of 2023 was just 309. Cava's entire store base would be little more than a rounding error for Chipotle. But this hints at the potential growth opportunity ahead for Cava, even if it only manages to grow to half the size of Chipotle. Notably, in 2023 the company pushed hard on the growth front, opening 72 new restaurants. That's probably too fast, so it is appropriate that management is only planning on 48 to 52 new locations in 2024. Still, at that pace, Cava is set for material growth in 2024. If it can come close to those numbers again in 2025 and 2026, which seems like a reasonable goal, the restaurant will add as many as 150 new locations over the next three years. So the business could grow by as much as 50%. That's huge! Each new location will bring with it new revenue, helping to boost the top line. This is something that Wall Street likes to see with young restaurant concepts. Right now, the company has a particularly compelling story to tell, noting that same-store sales growth came in at nearly 18% in 2023. That's an insanely high number and suggests the company's Mediterranean concept is in high demand. For reference, Chipotle's same-store sales totaled just under 8% in 2023. This is where investors need to pay extra close attention. It is unlikely that Cava can sustain such rapid same-store sales growth, which effectively measures the performance of stores that have been open for at least a year. The risk of a rapid expansion plan is that new locations start to cannibalize older ones, leading to weak same-store sales growth even as the new locations boost the overall top line. It isn't uncommon for Wall Street to push young restaurants so hard for growth that they stop paying as much attention to the core business. They just become new store machines. So, as Cava grows its stores and business over the next three years, investors need to focus on same-store sales. This will help you determine if the growth is broad based or if new locations are benefiting at the expense of older ones. If the latter is the case Cava is destined for trouble. The Chipotle comparison is probably a good one here, with a reasonable target for Cava's same-store growth being something similar to what its larger peer puts up. Cava is likely to be a bigger company in three years, perhaps materially so. But that doesn't mean it will be a better company. As an investor, you need to watch the top line and the store count. But don't forget to monitor same-store sales, as well. That's going to be a key determinant of whether or not Cava's growth is truly sustainable.

In addition – and in partnership with Food Rescue US — the restaurant has donated the fresh meals made during pre-opening team member training to community members in need. CAVA commissioned local Chicago-based artist, Alyssa Low, to design a custom mural for the restaurant interior.

193,2024-10-13 16:04:38,2024-04-24 09:45:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/forget-chipotle-check-coming-fast-094500761.html,Yahoo Finance,"Forget Chipotle, Check Out This Up-and-Coming Fast Casual Restaurant Entrant","In the bustling fast-casual dining sector, Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG) has set a strong benchmark for measuring success and innovation. Meanwhile, Cava Group (NYSE: CAVA) continues to carve out a niche and challenge established norms with its dynamic and health-oriented approach. Let's look deeper into Cava's business model, growth strategies, and potential as a smart long-term investment by putting it head-to-head against the industry leader. Cava's menu, infused with vibrant Mediterranean flavors, appears meticulously crafted to match the modern diner's desire for delicious and nutritious options. With protein-rich grains and a variety of fresh dips and abundant vegetable choices, the chain's offerings aim to delight the taste buds while simplifying healthy eating habits. That strategic approach to menu diversification continues to play a pivotal role in Cava's financial success, as evidenced by an impressive annual revenue surge to $717.1 million in 2023, representing a remarkable 59.8% increase over the previous year. By focusing on health-conscious, customizable meals, the company is directly responding to the growing consumer demand for dietary awareness and flexibility in meal options. While Chipotle also makes the customer king with customization, its menu flexibility falls short of Cava's options. Cava's substantial revenue growth demonstrates its effective market penetration and underscores its operational excellence, indicating a scalable and replicable business model. These factors also signal a resilient enterprise ready to thrive in diverse markets. That positions Cava stock as a potentially lucrative long-term opportunity, one you could hold for at least three to five years to grow your investment alongside the company. There's also some obvious room for growth when Cava goes head-to-head with Chipotle. Last year's USA Today Readers' Choice Awards gave the fast-casual Mexican chain a top-three slot. Cava placed 7th in the same category of best restaurants for quick, healthy food. Just making the top 10 is a big win, though. Like Chipotle, Cava embraces technology to improve how customers interact with its brand. In 2023, digital sales accounted for 36% of its total revenue, thanks to online ordering and a mobile app. The company's CEO seeks to create a ""multi-channel business,"" focusing on success capturing both walk-ins and online orders. Using digital sales isn't just about keeping up with trends; it shows Cava's ability to adapt to what customers want and stay competitive. These moves show the chain has what it takes to make more money and stand out in the fast-casual dining world. Both Cava and Chipotle use tech to make things better for customers, and Cava's fully integrated digital system gives it an extra boost. Tech helps Cava save money, serve customers better, and stay ahead of the game. In 2023, Cava expanded its presence by 30%, adding 72 new locations and aiming for over 1,000 stores by 2032. Alongside this growth in locations, average unit volume (AUV) increased from $2.4 million to $2.6 million. This rise in AUV indicates higher average sales per location, showing that the company's strategies are continuing to improve performance at individual restaurants. This growth in AUV is significant for Cava's financial performance and future prospects. It highlights the chain's ability to drive sales and revenue growth through effective strategy and operational execution. Cava's aggressive expansion and operational efficiency showcase its strength in the market, further evidenced by its stellar year-over-year performance. Cava's Mediterranean-inspired menu distinguishes it from Chipotle's Mexican-inspired offerings, allowing Cava to tap into a niche market segment and sidestep the giant. Cava also enjoys an advantage over Chipotle's more conventional menu selections. This strategic differentiation minimizes direct competition with Chipotle, potentially expanding Cava's market share. Cava's focused culinary approach also shields it from some of the intense competitive pressures faced by larger chains. By innovating within the realm of Mediterranean cuisine, Cava creates a buffer against economic fluctuations and shifts in consumer preferences, enhancing its market stability over the long term. As it scales, Cava faces the challenge of maintaining its distinctive brand identity and high standards of quality and service. The fast-casual market remains notoriously competitive. Cava must innovate continuously in its menu offerings as well as its marketing strategies and customer engagement techniques to stay ahead in the evolving landscape of dining preferences. Investing in Cava presents a promising opportunity for portfolio diversification. With its solid financial foundation, strategic plans, and unique niche, Cava appears ready for substantial growth. The brand's proactive expansion strategy, along with its emphasis on digital integration and adaptability to emerging trends, make it an enticing investment choice with significant long-term potential. While investors probably won't forget Chipotle, especially not with a market cap 10 times larger than that of the newcomer, there's ample room for multiple contenders in the fast-casual market, and plenty of compelling reasons to consider investing in both.

On the menu, diners will find options made with feta cheese, falafel, hummus, tzatziki, and other items that aren't typically found when eating out. Consumers are rallying behind the Cava brand at a head-turning pace. Consider that the company's restaurants generate $2.6 million in annual sales per location, on average -- and that's very high. In 2023, the company's same-store sales went up nearly 18% year over year in a clear sign of consumer demand. These same consumers are demanding more food from Cava, but the company only had 309 locations at the end of 2023 from which to serve them. But since the demand is clearly there, management has set an ambitious long-term goal: By 2032, it hopes to have 1,000 Cava locations. Growing to 1,000 locations won't be simple. The company will need to have infrastructure in place to support that many restaurants because all of them are company-owned. With this background, there's some good news for investors today: Cava just made a move that will support its growth through the end of the decade. The company plans to open about 50 new locations in 2024, which is incredible 16% year-over-year unit growth. But to get to 1,000 restaurants by 2032, its pace won't be able to slow much. Assuming it keeps up its pace to hit its goal for 2032, the company would have 750 places in 2030. Cava now has some of the infrastructure it needs to get it to 750 locations. In February, it opened a new food-prep facility in Virginia. And according to co-founder and CEO Brett Schulman, it's big enough to support that many restaurants. To be clear, a lot of Cava's food is prepared in the restaurants, but restaurants need to be fast and labor-efficient. Therefore, it makes sense to prepare some things in a centralized location when possible. For Cava, this includes making dressings and dips at its Virginia facility -- products it also sells in grocery stores. By being labor efficient and fast enough to handle high sales volume, Cava has really good restaurant-level profit margins. In 2023, its restaurant-level margin was 25% -- and it doesn't get much better than this in the restaurant space. If the company can keep margins high, it has a lot of potential as it expands to 1,000 locations. A food-prep facility isn't the only key to Cava's future success but is an important component. Investors should be encouraged when thinking about the chain's future growth potential. Management is making the moves now to make growth happen for many years.           ",

Irrespective how the market performs from here, these types of stocks may be in for considerable declines in price. Several of the stocks that have thus far this year been top-performers fit into this category. While in some cases, big run-ups have been justified, there are plenty that can be deemed as situations where shares have moved up “too far, too fast.” Admittedly, just because investors have gone overboard about a certain stock, doesn’t mean the market will soon come to its senses. Just ask the bears who have lost billions betting against Carvana (NYSE:CVNA). InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips However, don’t assume high-flier resiliency is universal. In the case of the following seven stocks due for a pullback, there are identifiable factors that strongly suggest a reversal lies ahead for each one. Source: Bruce VanLoon / Shutterstock.com Cava Group (NYSE:CAVA) bolted higher after its June 2023 IPO, but slid lower throughout the rest of last year. This year, however, it’s been a different story. Shares in this Mediterranean restaurant chain have been on a tear. Since January, CAVA stock is up 43%, making it one of this year’s top performing stocks. Chalk up this rally to beat-and-raise quarterly results and an analyst upgrade. Yet while the bulls may be betting that Cava is the next big restaurant growth story, this possibility has become overly priced-in. CAVA now trades for a staggering 257.2 times forward earnings. Yes, this valuation could be sustainable in the short-term, if sentiment holds. However, with short-interest at fairly moderate levels (15.7% of float), instead of squeezing higher when the company next reports results sometime next month, shares could move lower on “sell the news” profit taking.

Over the past year, CEG shares have zoomed 146.9% higher. Year-to-date alone, CEG is up by 57.3%. A major factor behind the sudden popularity of CEG stock has to do with the company’s “green wave” bona fides. Investors and decision-makers alike have warmed up to the idea of nuclear power’s potential to produce clean energy on a massive scale. Constellation has significant nuclear capacity, so it could strongly benefit from increased demand for zero-emissions nuclear power.                           ",

GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with T. The stock performance recently has been outstanding, rising almost 50% so far this year. Compared to small caps and the restaurant industry being relatively flat for the year, Cava Group has been a darling in an underperforming sector. CAVA Data by GuruFocus This all sounds wonderfulexcept some investors have sold a significant amount of their stake in the company over the past few months. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but it certainly warrants a closer look. Two major investors are responsible for almost all of the selling. Ron Shaich is chairman of the board of directors for Cava Group and sold 1.50 million shares in March. This dropped his share count from 11.60 million to just over 10.10 million (13% drop in ownership). Artal International S.C.A. is an investment firm based in Luxembourg. It has sold 5.50 million shares so far in 2024. This dropped its share count from 32 million to 26.50 million (17% drop in ownership). Even after the selling, Artal owns over 20% of CAVA Group and has two members on the board of directors. Source: Insider page on GuruFocus That is a lot of shares being sold. Regardless, it is important to note this type of selling is not necessarily a bad thing. Large investors might sell their positions to make a large purchase or rebalance their investment portfolio rather than because of a pessimistic outlook on the company. It should also be noted that Cava Group first started trading less than a year ago and this could be one of the first opportunities for investors to divest some of their shares. Even though these investors still hold a large position in CAVA Group, it is important to do our due diligence to make sure it is still a good investment. CAVA Group had its initial public offering in June 2023, which means doing historical comparisons is not going to be a viable way to value the stock.

As a result, plenty of restaurant stocks have fizzled out, but the industry has also produced some big winners. Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG), for example, is more than a 50-bagger from its 2006 initial public offering (IPO). After a number of disappointments in the restaurant industry in the 2010s, investor expectations seem to have been reset, and that has set up two restaurant stocks for big potential gains. Let's take a closer look at them. Plenty of restaurant stocks have been dubbed the next Chipotle. Those have mostly disappointed, but Cava Group (NYSE: CAVA) actually looks like the real deal. Cava is a fast-casual chain focused on Mediterranean food, and its menu and decor closely resemble Chipotle. It offers rolled-up pita sandwiches that look like burritos, along with bowls, and its restaurants have the same industrial minimalist aesthetic that Chipotle is known for at its locations. But it's not just the food that's reminiscent of Chipotle. Cava, which went public last June, also has the numbers to match. The company saw revenue jump 52.5% to $175.5 million in the fourth quarter, driven by rapid expansion and a same-store sales jump of 11.4% in the quarter. This shows that customers are returning frequently, a promising sign for the brand. Cava also has a strong restaurant-level profit margin, at 22.4% in Q4 and more than 24% for the full year, not far behind Chipotle. On a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis, the company is profitable, reporting a $2 million net income in Q4 as it's spending aggressively to grow the business. The company also has backing from one of the most successful people in fast-casual history. Ron Shaich, the founder of Panera, is currently the Chairman of Cava, and was an early investor, recognizing the opportunity the company had. Finally, Cava shares also look reasonably valued, especially as the restaurant chain has a huge growth opportunity in front of it, finishing 2023 with 309 restaurants. The stock currently trades at a price-to-sales ratio of 5.4, a similar valuation to Chipotle. If Cava can maintain its current momentum, the stock has a lot of room for growth ahead of it. Like Cava, Sweetgreen (NYSE: SG) is a fast-growing fast-casual stock, but it's still down substantially from the peak it reached after its IPO in 2021. Sweetgreen is the leader in the fast-casual salad niche. Its restaurants generate average unit volumes of $2.9 billion, on par with Chipotle, showing that the brand is popular.              ",

For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Jim Cramer’s New Picks: 5 Stocks to Buy. Jim Cramer said during his program on April 17 that we would need to see at least two months of ""cooling numbers"" before the Fed even considers to start cutting interest rates. He said many investors have been ""clinging"" to rate cut hopes but the economic activity, jobs market, M&A and IPO activity remains hot, giving the Fed no impetus to ease its monetary policy. Cramer lamented that the market is ""ignoring"" the positives and instead continues to react to weak earnings reports posted by some companies including JB Hunt and Prologis.  Jim Cramer added that while he would ""never ever fight"" his viewers who want to sell their stocks right now amid the current market pullback and declines, selling stocks when they are low is not his ""style."" Cramer said that some ""big picture negatives"" were also weighing the market down. The CNBC host said long-term interest rates were rising, commodity and oil prices were soaring before seeing a decline recently amid hopes that Israel won't react to Iran's missile attacks. However, Cramer said these ""green shoots"" are crushed by the bear quickly, leaving no room for positivity. Jim Cramer said that this is a ""market that wants to go down"" and since major stocks like Apple and Tesla are no longer giving a push to the broader market like they did in the recent past, people might think it would make sense to sell out. But Cramer questioned the temptation to immediately sell out of the current market, saying it's never a good idea to sell everything at once. Jim Cramer revealed that his charitable trust kept selling stocks ""every day in the last four weeks."" But Cramer said he didn’t sell his stocks on a decline. Instead, his charitable trust used a strategy called ""scaling out."" ""As the stock went higher we sold some shares to raise some cash. If it ever comes back down we can always use that cash to scale back in."" Cramer said he thinks the market is seeing a ""short-term peak"" because the Fed might have ""jumped the gun"" even after indicating earlier in the year that there won't be any need for more rate hikes.
